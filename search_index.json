Proxy With Apache","summary":"Restricting access to your registry using an apache proxy","keywords":"","body":"Use-case\nPeople already relying on an apache proxy to authenticate their users to other services might want to leverage it and have Registry communications tunneled through the same pipeline.\nUsually, that includes enterprise setups using LDAP/AD on the backend and a SSO mechanism fronting their internal http portal.\nAlternatives\nIf you just want authentication for your registry, and are happy maintaining users access separately, you should really consider sticking with the native basic auth registry feature.\nSolution\nWith the method presented here, you implement basic authentication for docker engines in a reverse proxy that sits in front of your registry.\nWhile we

You can run a local registry mirror and point all your daemons\nthere, to avoid this extra internet traffic.\n\nNote\nDocker Official Images are an intellectual property of Docker.\n\nAlternatives\nAlternatively, if the set of images you are using is well delimited, you can\nsimply pull them manually and push them to a simple, local, private registry.\nFurthermore, if your images are all built in-house, not using the Hub at all and\nrelying entirely on your local registry is the simplest scenario.\nGotcha\nIt's currently not possible to mirror another private registry. Only the central\nHub can be mirrored.\n\nNote\nMirrors of Docker Hub are still subject to Docker's fair usage policy{: target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=“”}.\n\nSolution\nThe Registry can be configured as a pull through cache. In this mode a Registry\nresponds to all normal docker pull requests but stores all content locally.\nHow does it work?\nThe first time you request an image from your local registry mirror, it pulls\nthe image from the public Docker registry and stores it locally before handing\nit back to you. On subsequent requests, the local registry mirror is able to\nserve the image from its own storage.\nWhat if the content changes on the Hub?\nWhen a pull is attempted with a tag, the Registry checks the remote to\nensure if it has the latest version of the requested content. Otherwise, it\nfetches and caches the latest content.\nWhat about my disk?\nIn environments with high churn rates, stale data can build up in the cache.\nWhen running as a pull through cache the Registry periodically removes old\ncontent to save disk space. Subsequent requests for removed content causes a\nremote fetch and local re-caching.\nTo ensure best performance and guarantee correctness the Registry cache should\nbe configured to use the filesystem driver for storage.\nRun a Registry as a pull-through cache\nThe easiest way to run a registry as a pull through cache is to run the official\nRegistry image.\nAt least, you need to specify proxy.remoteurl within /etc/docker/registry/config.yml\nas described in the following subsection.\nMultiple registry caches can be deployed over the same back-end. A single\nregistry cache ensures that concurrent requests do not pull duplicate data,\nbut this property does not hold true for a registry cache cluster.\n\nNote\nService accounts included in the Team plan are limited to 5,000 pulls per day. See Service Accounts for more details.\n\nConfigure the cache\nTo configure a Registry to run as a pull through cache, the addition of a\nproxy section is required to the config file.\nTo access private images on the Docker Hub, a username and password can\nbe supplied.\nproxy:\n  remoteurl: https://registry-1.docker.io\n  username: [username]\n  password: [password]\n\n\nWarning: If you specify a username and password, it's very important to\nunderstand that private resources that this user has access to Docker Hub is\nmade available on your mirror. You must secure your mirror by\nimplementing authentication if you expect these resources to stay private!\nWarning: For the scheduler to clean up old entries, delete must\nbe enabled in the registry configuration. See\nRegistry Configuration for more details.\n\nConfigure the Docker daemon\nEither pass the --registry-mirror option when starting dockerd manually,\nor edit /etc/docker/daemon.json\nand add the registry-mirrors key and value, to make the change persistent.\n{\n  \"registry-mirrors\": [\"https://\"]\n}\n\nSave the file and reload Docker for the change to take effect.\n\nSome log messages that appear to be errors are actually informational messages.\nCheck the level field to determine whether\nthe message is warning you about an error or is giving you information.\nFor example, this log message is informational:\ntime=\"2017-06-02T15:47:37Z\" level=info msg=\"error statting local store, serving from upstream: unknown blob\" go.version=go1.7.4\n\nIt's telling you that the file doesn't exist yet in the local cache and is\nbeing pulled from upstream.\n\n"},"recipes/nginx.html":{"url":"recipes/nginx.html","title":"Authenticate Proxy With Nginx","summary":"Restricting access to your registry using a nginx proxy","keywords":"","body":"Use-case\nPeople already relying on a nginx proxy to authenticate their users to other\nservices might want to leverage it and have Registry communications tunneled\nthrough the same pipeline.\nUsually, that includes enterprise setups using LDAP/AD on the backend and a SSO\nmechanism fronting their internal http portal.\nAlternatives\nIf you just want authentication for your registry, and are happy maintaining\nusers access separately, you should really consider sticking with the native\nbasic auth registry feature.\nSolution\nWith the method presented here, you implement basic authentication for docker\nengines in a reverse proxy that sits in front of your registry.\nWhile we use a simple htpasswd file as an example, any other nginx\nauthentication backend should be fairly easy to implement once you are done with\nthe example.\nWe also implement push restriction (to a limited user group) for the sake of the\nexample.

Specifically, it describes the JSON\nWeb Token schema that distribution/distribution has adopted to implement the\nclient-opaque Bearer token issued by an authentication service and\nunderstood by the registry.\nThis document borrows heavily from the JSON Web Token Draft Spec\nGetting a Bearer Token\nFor this example, the client makes an HTTP GET request to the following URL:\nhttps://auth.docker.io/token?service=registry.docker.io&scope=repository:samalba/my-app:pull,push\nThe token server should first attempt to authenticate the client using any\nauthentication credentials provided with the request. As of Docker 1.8, the\nregistry client in the Docker Engine only supports Basic Authentication to\nthese token servers. If an attempt to authenticate to the token server fails,\nthe token server should return a 401 Unauthorized response indicating that\nthe provided credentials are invalid.\nWhether the token server requires authentication is up to the policy of that\naccess control provider. Some requests may require authentication to determine\naccess (such as pushing or pulling a private repository) while others may not\n(such as pulling from a public repository).\nAfter authenticating the client (which may simply be an anonymous client if\nno attempt was made to authenticate), the token server must next query its\naccess control list to determine whether the client has the requested scope. In\nthis example request, if I have authenticated as user jlhawn, the token\nserver will determine what access I have to the repository samalba/my-app\nhosted by the entity registry.docker.io.\nOnce the token server has determined what access the client has to the\nresources requested in the scope parameter, it will take the intersection of\nthe set of requested actions on each resource and the set of actions that the\nclient has in fact been granted. If the client only has a subset of the\nrequested access it must not be considered an error as it is not the\nresponsibility of the token server to indicate authorization errors as part of\nthis workflow.\nContinuing with the example request, the token server will find that the\nclient's set of granted access to the repository is [pull, push] which when\nintersected with the requested access [pull, push] yields an equal set. If\nthe granted access set was found only to be [pull] then the intersected set\nwould only be [pull]. If the client has no access to the repository then the\nintersected set would be empty, [].\nIt is this intersected set of access which is placed in the returned token.\nThe server will now construct a JSON Web Token to sign and return. A JSON Web\nToken has 3 main parts:\n\nHeaders\nThe header of a JSON Web Token is a standard JOSE header. The \"typ\" field\nwill be \"JWT\" and it will also contain the \"alg\" which identifies the\nsigning algorithm used to produce the signature.

The token server should not return errors when the user does not\nhave the requested authorization. Instead, the returned token should indicate\nwhatever of the requested scope the client does have (the intersection of\nrequested and granted access). If the token does not supply proper\nauthorization then the registry will return the appropriate error.\nAt no point in this process should the registry need to call back to the\nauthorization server.

Tokens always have the context of a user which\nthe token was originally created for. This document describes how these\nrestrictions are represented and enforced by the authorization server and\nresource providers.\nScope Components\nSubject (Authenticated User)\nThe subject represents the user for which a token is valid. Any actions\nperformed using an access token should be considered on behalf of the subject.\nThis is included in the sub field of access token JWT. A refresh token should\nbe limited to a single subject and only be able to give out access tokens for\nthat subject.\nAudience (Resource Provider)\nThe audience represents a resource provider which is intended to be able to\nperform the actions specified in the access token. Any resource provider which\ndoes not match the audience should not use that access token. The audience is\nincluded in the aud field of the access token JWT. A refresh token should be\nlimited to a single audience and only be able to give out access tokens for that\naudience.\nResource Type\nThe resource type represents the type of resource which the resource name is\nintended to represent. This type may be specific to a resource provider but must\nbe understood by the authorization server in order to validate the subject\nis authorized for a specific resource.\nResource Class\nThe resource type might have a resource class which further classifies the\nthe resource name within the resource type. A class is not required and\nis specific to the resource type.\nExample Resource Types\n\nrepository - represents a single repository within a registry. A\nrepository may represent many manifest or content blobs, but the resource type\nis considered the collections of those items. Actions which may be performed on\na repository are pull for accessing the collection and push for adding to\nit. By default the repository type has the class of image.\nrepository(plugin) - represents a single repository of plugins within a\nregistry. A plugin repository has the same content and actions as a repository.\nregistry - represents the entire registry. Used for administrative actions\nor lookup operations that span an entire registry.\n\nResource Name\nThe resource name represent the name which identifies a resource for a resource\nprovider. A resource is identified by this name and the provided resource type.\nAn example of a resource name would be the name component of an image tag, such\nas \"samalba/myapp\" or \"hostname/samalba/myapp\".\nResource Actions\nThe resource actions define the actions which the access token allows to be\nperformed on the identified resource. These actions are type specific but will\nnormally have actions identifying read and write access on the resource. Example\nfor the repository type are pull for read access and push for write\naccess.\nAuthorization Server Use\nEach access token request may include a scope and an audience. The subject is\nalways derived from the passed in credentials or refresh token. When using\na refresh token the passed in audience must match the audience defined for\nthe refresh token. The audience (resource provider) is provided using the\nservice field. Multiple resource scopes may be provided using multiple scope\nfields on the GET request. The POST request only takes in a single\nscope field but may use a space to separate a list of multiple resource\nscopes.\nResource Scope Grammar\nscope                   := resourcescope [ ' ' resourcescope ]*\nresourcescope           := resourcetype  \":\" resourcename  \":\" action [ ',' action ]*\nresourcetype            := resourcetypevalue [ '(' resourcetypevalue ')' ]\nresourcetypevalue       := /[a-z0-9]+/\nresourcename            := [ hostname '/' ] component [ '/' component ]*\nhostname                := hostcomponent ['.' hostcomponent]* [':' port-number]\nhostcomponent           := /([a-zA-Z0-9]|[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])/\nport-number             := /[0-9]+/\naction                  := /[a-z]*/\ncomponent               := alpha-numeric [ separator alpha-numeric ]*\nalpha-numeric           := /[a-z0-9]+/\nseparator               := /[_.]|__|[-]*/\nFull reference grammar is defined\nhere. Currently\nthe scope name grammar is a subset of the reference grammar.\n\nNOTE: that the resourcename may contain one : due to a possible port\nnumber in the hostname component of the resourcename, so a naive\nimplementation that interprets the first three :-delimited tokens of a\nscope to be the resourcetype, resourcename, and a list of action\nwould be insufficient.\n\nResource Provider Use\nOnce a resource provider has verified the authenticity of the scope through\nJWT access token verification, the resource provider must ensure that scope\nsatisfies the request. The resource provider should match the given audience\naccording to name or URI the resource provider uses to identify itself. Any\ndenial based on subject is not defined here and is up to resource provider, the\nsubject is mainly provided for audit logs and any other user-specific rules\nwhich may need to be provided but are not defined by the authorization server.\nThe resource provider must ensure that ANY resource being accessed as the\nresult of a request has the appropriate access scope. Both the resource type\nand resource name must match the accessed resource and an appropriate action\nscope must be included.\nWhen appropriate authorization is not provided either due to lack of scope\nor missing token, the resource provider to return a WWW-AUTHENTICATE HTTP\nheader with the realm as the authorization server, the service as the\nexpected audience identifying string, and a scope field for each required\nresource scope to complete the request.\nJWT Access Tokens\nEach JWT access token may only have a single subject and audience but multiple\nresource scopes. The subject and audience are put into standard JWT fields\nsub and aud. The resource scope is put into the access field. The\nstructure of the access field can be seen in the\njwt documentation.\nRefresh Tokens\nA refresh token must be defined for a single subject and audience. Further\nrestricting scope to specific type, name, and actions combinations should be\ndone by fetching an access token using the refresh token.

Under\nthe Registry V2 workflow, clients should contact the registry first. If the\nregistry server requires authentication it will return a 401 Unauthorized\nresponse with a WWW-Authenticate header detailing how to authenticate to this\nregistry.\nFor example, say I (username jlhawn) am attempting to push an image to the\nrepository samalba/my-app. For the registry to authorize this, I will need\npush access to the samalba/my-app repository. The registry will first\nreturn this response:\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nContent-Type: application/json\nDocker-Distribution-Api-Version: registry/2.0\nWww-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"https://auth.docker.io/token\",service=\"registry.docker.io\",scope=\"repository:samalba/my-app:pull,push\"\nDate: Thu, 10 Sep 2015 19:32:31 GMT\nContent-Length: 235\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000\n\n{\"errors\":[{\"code\":\"UNAUTHORIZED\",\"message\":\"access to the requested resource is not authorized\",\"detail\":[{\"Type\":\"repository\",\"Name\":\"samalba/my-app\",\"Action\":\"pull\"},{\"Type\":\"repository\",\"Name\":\"samalba/my-app\",\"Action\":\"push\"}]}]}\nNote the HTTP Response Header indicating the auth challenge:\nWww-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"https://auth.docker.io/token\",service=\"registry.docker.io\",scope=\"repository:samalba/my-app:pull,push\"\nThis format is documented in Section 3 of RFC 6750: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage\nThis challenge indicates that the registry requires a token issued by the\nspecified token server and that the request the client is attempting will\nneed to include sufficient access entries in its claim set.

The above example would be specified as:\n        scope=repository:samalba/my-app:push.

At least one of these fields must be specified, but\n        both may also appear (for compatibility with older clients).

This token should be kept secure\n        by the client and only sent to the authorization server which issues\n        bearer tokens. This field will only be set when `offline_token=true` is\n        provided in the request.\n    \n\n\nExample\nFor this example, the client makes an HTTP GET request to the following URL:\nhttps://auth.docker.io/token?service=registry.docker.io&scope=repository:samalba/my-app:pull,push\nThe token server should first attempt to authenticate the client using any\nauthentication credentials provided with the request. From Docker 1.11 the\nDocker engine supports both Basic Authentication and OAuth2 for\ngetting tokens. Docker 1.10 and before, the registry client in the Docker Engine\nonly supports Basic Authentication. If an attempt to authenticate to the token\nserver fails, the token server should return a 401 Unauthorized response\nindicating that the provided credentials are invalid.\nWhether the token server requires authentication is up to the policy of that\naccess control provider. Some requests may require authentication to determine\naccess (such as pushing or pulling a private repository) while others may not\n(such as pulling from a public repository).\nAfter authenticating the client (which may simply be an anonymous client if\nno attempt was made to authenticate), the token server must next query its\naccess control list to determine whether the client has the requested scope. In\nthis example request, if I have authenticated as user jlhawn, the token\nserver will determine what access I have to the repository samalba/my-app\nhosted by the entity registry.docker.io.\nOnce the token server has determined what access the client has to the\nresources requested in the scope parameter, it will take the intersection of\nthe set of requested actions on each resource and the set of actions that the\nclient has in fact been granted. If the client only has a subset of the\nrequested access it must not be considered an error as it is not the\nresponsibility of the token server to indicate authorization errors as part of\nthis workflow.\nContinuing with the example request, the token server will find that the\nclient's set of granted access to the repository is [pull, push] which when\nintersected with the requested access [pull, push] yields an equal set. If\nthe granted access set was found only to be [pull] then the intersected set\nwould only be [pull]. If the client has no access to the repository then the\nintersected set would be empty, [].\nIt is this intersected set of access which is placed in the returned token.\nThe server then constructs an implementation-specific token with this\nintersected set of access, and returns it to the Docker client to use to\nauthenticate to the audience service (within the indicated window of time):\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\"token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IlBZWU86VEVXVTpWN0pIOjI2SlY6QVFUWjpMSkMzOlNYVko6WEdIQTozNEYyOjJMQVE6WlJNSzpaN1E2In0.eyJpc3MiOiJhdXRoLmRvY2tlci5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiJqbGhhd24iLCJhdWQiOiJyZWdpc3RyeS5kb2NrZXIuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNDE1Mzg3MzE1LCJuYmYiOjE0MTUzODcwMTUsImlhdCI6MTQxNTM4NzAxNSwianRpIjoidFlKQ08xYzZjbnl5N2tBbjBjN3JLUGdiVjFIMWJGd3MiLCJhY2Nlc3MiOlt7InR5cGUiOiJyZXBvc2l0b3J5IiwibmFtZSI6InNhbWFsYmEvbXktYXBwIiwiYWN0aW9ucyI6WyJwdXNoIl19XX0.QhflHPfbd6eVF4lM9bwYpFZIV0PfikbyXuLx959ykRTBpe3CYnzs6YBK8FToVb5R47920PVLrh8zuLzdCr9t3w\", \"expires_in\": 3600,\"issued_at\": \"2009-11-10T23:00:00Z\"}\nUsing the Bearer token\nOnce the client has a token, it will try the registry request again with the\ntoken placed in the HTTP Authorization header like so:\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IkJWM0Q6MkFWWjpVQjVaOktJQVA6SU5QTDo1RU42Ok40SjQ6Nk1XTzpEUktFOkJWUUs6M0ZKTDpQT1RMIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJhdXRoLmRvY2tlci5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiJCQ0NZOk9VNlo6UUVKNTpXTjJDOjJBVkM6WTdZRDpBM0xZOjQ1VVc6NE9HRDpLQUxMOkNOSjU6NUlVTCIsImF1ZCI6InJlZ2lzdHJ5LmRvY2tlci5jb20iLCJleHAiOjE0MTUzODczMTUsIm5iZiI6MTQxNTM4NzAxNSwiaWF0IjoxNDE1Mzg3MDE1LCJqdGkiOiJ0WUpDTzFjNmNueXk3a0FuMGM3cktQZ2JWMUgxYkZ3cyIsInNjb3BlIjoiamxoYXduOnJlcG9zaXRvcnk6c2FtYWxiYS9teS1hcHA6cHVzaCxwdWxsIGpsaGF3bjpuYW1lc3BhY2U6c2FtYWxiYTpwdWxsIn0.Y3zZSwaZPqy4y9oRBVRImZyv3m_S9XDHF1tWwN7mL52C_IiA73SJkWVNsvNqpJIn5h7A2F8biv_S2ppQ1lgkbw\nThis is also described in Section 2.1 of RFC 6750: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage\n"},"spec/api.html":{"url":"spec/api.html","title":"HTTP API V 2","summary":"Specification for the Registry API.","keywords":"","body":"Docker Registry HTTP API V2\nIntroduction\nThe Docker Registry HTTP API is the protocol to facilitate distribution of\nimages to the docker engine. It interacts with instances of the docker\nregistry, which is a service to manage information about docker images and\nenable their distribution. The specification covers the operation of version 2\nof this API, known as Docker Registry HTTP API V2.\nWhile the V1 registry protocol is usable, there are several problems with the\narchitecture that have led to this new version. The main driver of this\nspecification is a set of changes to the Docker image format, covered in\ndocker/docker#8093.\nThe new, self-contained image manifest simplifies image definition and improves\nsecurity. This specification will build on that work, leveraging new properties\nof the manifest format to improve performance, reduce bandwidth usage and\ndecrease the likelihood of backend corruption.\nFor relevant details and history leading up to this specification, please see\nthe following issues:\n\ndocker/docker#8093\ndocker/docker#9015\ndocker/docker-registry#612\n\nScope\nThis specification covers the URL layout and protocols of the interaction\nbetween docker registry and docker core. This will affect the docker core\nregistry API and the rewrite of docker-registry. Docker registry\nimplementations may implement other API endpoints, but they are not covered by\nthis specification.\nThis includes the following features:\n\nNamespace-oriented URI Layout\nPUSH/PULL registry server for V2 image manifest format\nResumable layer PUSH support\nV2 Client library implementation\n\nWhile authentication and authorization support will influence this\nspecification, details of the protocol will be left to a future specification.\nRelevant header definitions and error codes are present to provide an\nindication of what a client may encounter.\nFuture\nThere are features that have been discussed during the process of cutting this\nspecification. The following is an incomplete list:\n\nImmutable image references\nMultiple architecture support\nMigration from v2compatibility representation\n\nThese may represent features that are either out of the scope of this\nspecification, the purview of another specification or have been deferred to a\nfuture version.\nUse Cases\nFor the most part, the use cases of the former registry API apply to the new\nversion. Differentiating use cases are covered below.\nImage Verification\nA docker engine instance would like to run verified image named\n\"library/ubuntu\", with the tag \"latest\". The engine contacts the registry,\nrequesting the manifest for \"library/ubuntu:latest\". An untrusted registry\nreturns a manifest. Before proceeding to download the individual layers, the\nengine verifies the manifest's signature, ensuring that the content was\nproduced from a trusted source and no tampering has occurred. After each layer\nis downloaded, the engine verifies the digest of the layer, ensuring that the\ncontent matches that specified by the manifest.\nResumable Push\nCompany X's build servers lose connectivity to docker registry before\ncompleting an image layer transfer. After connectivity returns, the build\nserver attempts to re-upload the image. The registry notifies the build server\nthat the upload has already been partially attempted. The build server\nresponds by only sending the remaining data to complete the image file.\nResumable Pull\nCompany X is having more connectivity problems but this time in their\ndeployment datacenter. When downloading an image, the connection is\ninterrupted before completion. The client keeps the partial data and uses http\nRange requests to avoid downloading repeated data.\nLayer Upload De-duplication\nCompany Y's build system creates two identical docker layers from build\nprocesses A and B. Build process A completes uploading the layer before B.\nWhen process B attempts to upload the layer, the registry indicates that its\nnot necessary because the layer is already known.\nIf process A and B upload the same layer at the same time, both operations\nwill proceed and the first to complete will be stored in the registry (Note:\nwe may modify this to prevent dogpile with some locking mechanism).\nChanges\nThe V2 specification has been written to work as a living document, specifying\nonly what is certain and leaving what is not specified open or to future\nchanges. Only non-conflicting additions should be made to the API and accepted\nchanges should avoid preventing future changes from happening.\nThis section should be updated when changes are made to the specification,\nindicating what is different. Optionally, we may start marking parts of the\nspecification to correspond with the versions enumerated here.\nEach set of changes is given a letter corresponding to a set of modifications\nthat were applied to the baseline specification. These are merely for\nreference and shouldn't be used outside the specification other than to\nidentify a set of modifications.\n\n  l\n  \n    \n      Document TOOMANYREQUESTS error code.\n    \n  \n\n  k\n  \n    \n      Document use of Accept and Content-Type headers in manifests endpoint.\n    \n  \n\n  j\n  \n    \n      Add ability to mount blobs across repositories.\n    \n  \n\n  i\n  \n    \n      Clarified expected behavior response to manifest HEAD request.\n    \n  \n\n  h\n  \n    \n      All mention of tarsum removed.\n    \n  \n\n  g\n  \n    \n      Clarify behavior of pagination behavior with unspecified parameters.\n    \n  \n\n  f\n  \n    \n      Specify the delete API for layers and manifests.\n    \n  \n\n  e\n  \n    \n      Added support for listing registry contents.\n      Added pagination to tags API.\n      Added common approach to support pagination.\n    \n  \n\n  d\n  \n    \n      Allow repository name components to be one character.\n      Clarified that single component names are allowed.\n    \n  \n\n  c\n  \n    \n      Added section covering digest format.\n      Added more clarification that manifest cannot be deleted by tag.\n    \n  \n\n  b\n  \n    \n      Added capability of doing streaming upload to PATCH blob upload.\n      Updated PUT blob upload to no longer take final chunk, now requires entire data or no data.\n      Removed `416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable` response status from PUT blob upload.\n    \n  \n\n  a\n  \n    \n      Added support for immutable manifest references in manifest endpoints.\n      Deleting a manifest by tag has been deprecated.\n      Specified `Docker-Content-Digest` header for appropriate entities.\n      Added error code for unsupported operations.\n    \n  \n\n\nOverview\nThis section covers client flows and details of the API endpoints. The URI\nlayout of the new API is structured to support a rich authentication and\nauthorization model by leveraging namespaces. All endpoints will be prefixed\nby the API version and the repository name:\n/v2//\nFor example, an API endpoint that will work with the library/ubuntu\nrepository, the URI prefix will be:\n/v2/library/ubuntu/\nThis scheme provides rich access control over various operations and methods\nusing the URI prefix and http methods that can be controlled in variety of\nways.\nClassically, repository names have always been two path components where each\npath component is less than 30 characters. The V2 registry API does not\nenforce this. The rules for a repository name are as follows:\n\nA repository name is broken up into path components. A component of a\nrepository name must be at least one lowercase, alpha-numeric characters,\noptionally separated by periods, dashes or underscores. More strictly, it\nmust match the regular expression [a-z0-9]+(?:[._-][a-z0-9]+)*.\nIf a repository  name has two or more path components, they must be\nseparated by a forward slash (\"/\").\nThe total length of a repository name, including slashes, must be less than\n256 characters.\n\nThese name requirements only apply to the registry API and should accept a\nsuperset of what is supported by other docker ecosystem components.\nAll endpoints should support aggressive http caching, compression and range\nheaders, where appropriate. The new API attempts to leverage HTTP semantics\nwhere possible but may break from standards to implement targeted features.\nFor detail on individual endpoints, please see the Detail\nsection.\nErrors\nActionable failure conditions, covered in detail in their relevant sections,\nare reported as part of 4xx responses, in a json response body. One or more\nerrors will be returned in the following format:\n{\n    \"errors\": [{\n            \"code\": ,\n            \"message\": ,\n            \"detail\": \n        },\n        ...\n    ]\n}\nThe code field will be a unique identifier, all caps with underscores by\nconvention. The message field will be a human readable string. The optional\ndetail field may contain arbitrary json data providing information the\nclient can use to resolve the issue.\nWhile the client can take action on certain error codes, the registry may add\nnew error codes over time. All client implementations should treat unknown\nerror codes as UNKNOWN, allowing future error codes to be added without\nbreaking API compatibility. For the purposes of the specification error codes\nwill only be added and never removed.\nFor a complete account of all error codes, please see the Errors\nsection.\nAPI Version Check\nA minimal endpoint, mounted at /v2/ will provide version support information\nbased on its response statuses. The request format is as follows:\nGET /v2/\nIf a 200 OK response is returned, the registry implements the V2(.1)\nregistry API and the client may proceed safely with other V2 operations.\nOptionally, the response may contain information about the supported paths in\nthe response body. The client should be prepared to ignore this data.\nIf a 401 Unauthorized response is returned, the client should take action\nbased on the contents of the \"WWW-Authenticate\" header and try the endpoint\nagain. Depending on access control setup, the client may still have to\nauthenticate against different resources, even if this check succeeds.\nIf 404 Not Found response status, or other unexpected status, is returned,\nthe client should proceed with the assumption that the registry does not\nimplement V2 of the API.\nWhen a 200 OK or 401 Unauthorized response is returned, the\n\"Docker-Distribution-API-Version\" header should be set to \"registry/2.0\".\nClients may require this header value to determine if the endpoint serves this\nAPI. When this header is omitted, clients may fallback to an older API version.\nContent Digests\nThis API design is driven heavily by content addressability.\nThe core of this design is the concept of a content addressable identifier. It\nuniquely identifies content by taking a collision-resistant hash of the bytes.\nSuch an identifier can be independently calculated and verified by selection\nof a common algorithm. If such an identifier can be communicated in a secure\nmanner, one can retrieve the content from an insecure source, calculate it\nindependently and be certain that the correct content was obtained. Put simply,\nthe identifier is a property of the content.\nTo disambiguate from other concepts, we call this identifier a digest. A\ndigest is a serialized hash result, consisting of a algorithm and hex\nportion. The algorithm identifies the methodology used to calculate the\ndigest. The hex portion is the hex-encoded result of the hash.\nWe define a digest string to match the following grammar:\ndigest      := algorithm \":\" hex\nalgorithm   := /[A-Za-z0-9_+.-]+/\nhex         := /[A-Fa-f0-9]+/\nSome examples of digests include the following:\n\n\n\ndigest\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nsha256:6c3c624b58dbbcd3c0dd82b4c53f04194d1247c6eebdaab7c610cf7d66709b3b\nCommon sha256 based digest\n\n\n\n\nWhile the algorithm does allow one to implement a wide variety of\nalgorithms, compliant implementations should use sha256. Heavy processing of\ninput before calculating a hash is discouraged to avoid degrading the\nuniqueness of the digest but some canonicalization may be performed to\nensure consistent identifiers.\nLet's use a simple example in pseudo-code to demonstrate a digest calculation:\nlet C = 'a small string'\nlet B = sha256(C)\nlet D = 'sha256:' + EncodeHex(B)\nlet ID(C) = D\nAbove, we have bytestring C passed into a function, SHA256, that returns a\nbytestring B, which is the hash of C. D gets the algorithm concatenated\nwith the hex encoding of B. We then define the identifier of C to ID(C)\nas equal to D. A digest can be verified by independently calculating D and\ncomparing it with identifier ID(C).\nDigest Header\nTo provide verification of http content, any response may include a\nDocker-Content-Digest header. This will include the digest of the target\nentity returned in the response. For blobs, this is the entire blob content. For\nmanifests, this is the manifest body without the signature content, also known\nas the JWS payload. Note that the commonly used canonicalization for digest\ncalculation may be dependent on the mediatype of the content, such as with\nmanifests.\nThe client may choose to ignore the header or may verify it to ensure content\nintegrity and transport security. This is most important when fetching by a\ndigest. To ensure security, the content should be verified against the digest\nused to fetch the content. At times, the returned digest may differ from that\nused to initiate a request. Such digests are considered to be from different\ndomains, meaning they have different values for algorithm. In such a case,\nthe client may choose to verify the digests in both domains or ignore the\nserver's digest. To maintain security, the client must always verify the\ncontent against the digest used to fetch the content.\n\nIMPORTANT: If a digest is used to fetch content, the client should use\nthe same digest used to fetch the content to verify it. The header\nDocker-Content-Digest should not be trusted over the \"local\" digest.\n\nPulling An Image\nAn \"image\" is a combination of a JSON manifest and individual layer files. The\nprocess of pulling an image centers around retrieving these two components.\nThe first step in pulling an image is to retrieve the manifest. For reference,\nthe relevant manifest fields for the registry are the following:\n\n\n\nfield\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nThe name of the image.\n\n\n\ntag\nThe tag for this version of the image.\n\n\n\nfsLayers\nA list of layer descriptors (including digest)\n\n\n\nsignature\nA JWS used to verify the manifest content\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the manifest format, please see\ndocker/docker#8093.\nWhen the manifest is in hand, the client must verify the signature to ensure\nthe names and layers are valid. Once confirmed, the client will then use the\ndigests to download the individual layers. Layers are stored in as blobs in\nthe V2 registry API, keyed by their digest.\nPulling an Image Manifest\nThe image manifest can be fetched with the following url:\nGET /v2//manifests/\nThe name and reference parameter identify the image and are required. The\nreference may include a tag or digest.\nThe client should include an Accept header indicating which manifest content\ntypes it supports. For more details on the manifest formats and their content\ntypes, see manifest-v2-1.md and\nmanifest-v2-2.md. In a successful response, the Content-Type\nheader will indicate which manifest type is being returned.\nA 404 Not Found response will be returned if the image is unknown to the\nregistry. If the image exists and the response is successful, the image\nmanifest will be returned, with the following format (see\ndocker/docker#8093 for details):\n{\n   \"name\": ,\n   \"tag\": ,\n   \"fsLayers\": [\n      {\n         \"blobSum\": \n      },\n      ...\n    ]\n   ],\n   \"history\": ,\n   \"signature\": \n}\nThe client should verify the returned manifest signature for authenticity\nbefore fetching layers.\nExisting Manifests\nThe image manifest can be checked for existence with the following url:\nHEAD /v2//manifests/\nThe name and reference parameter identify the image and are required. The\nreference may include a tag or digest.\nA 404 Not Found response will be returned if the image is unknown to the\nregistry. If the image exists and the response is successful the response will\nbe as follows:\n200 OK\nContent-Length: \nDocker-Content-Digest: \nPulling a Layer\nLayers are stored in the blob portion of the registry, keyed by digest.\nPulling a layer is carried out by a standard http request. The URL is as\nfollows:\nGET /v2//blobs/\nAccess to a layer will be gated by the name of the repository but is\nidentified uniquely in the registry by digest.\nThis endpoint may issue a 307 (302 for \nThis endpoint should support aggressive HTTP caching for image layers. Support\nfor Etags, modification dates and other cache control headers should be\nincluded. To allow for incremental downloads, Range requests should be\nsupported, as well.\nPushing An Image\nPushing an image works in the opposite order as a pull. After assembling the\nimage manifest, the client must first push the individual layers. When the\nlayers are fully pushed into the registry, the client should upload the signed\nmanifest.\nThe details of each step of the process are covered in the following sections.\nPushing a Layer\nAll layer uploads use two steps to manage the upload process. The first step\nstarts the upload in the registry service, returning a url to carry out the\nsecond step. The second step uses the upload url to transfer the actual data.\nUploads are started with a POST request which returns a url that can be used\nto push data and check upload status.\nThe Location header will be used to communicate the upload location after\neach request. While it won't change in the this specification, clients should\nuse the most recent value returned by the API.\nStarting An Upload\nTo begin the process, a POST request should be issued in the following format:\nPOST /v2//blobs/uploads/\nThe parameters of this request are the image namespace under which the layer\nwill be linked. Responses to this request are covered below.\nExisting Layers\nThe existence of a layer can be checked via a HEAD request to the blob store\nAPI. The request should be formatted as follows:\nHEAD /v2//blobs/\nIf the layer with the digest specified in digest is available, a 200 OK\nresponse will be received, with no actual body content (this is according to\nhttp specification). The response will look as follows:\n200 OK\nContent-Length: \nDocker-Content-Digest: \nWhen this response is received, the client can assume that the layer is\nalready available in the registry under the given name and should take no\nfurther action to upload the layer. Note that the binary digests may differ\nfor the existing registry layer, but the digests will be guaranteed to match.\nUploading the Layer\nIf the POST request is successful, a 202 Accepted response will be returned\nwith the upload URL in the Location header:\n202 Accepted\nLocation: /v2//blobs/uploads/\nRange: bytes=0-\nContent-Length: 0\nDocker-Upload-UUID: \nThe rest of the upload process can be carried out with the returned url,\ncalled the \"Upload URL\" from the Location header. All responses to the\nupload url, whether sending data or getting status, will be in this format.\nThough the URI format (/v2//blobs/uploads/) for the Location\nheader is specified, clients should treat it as an opaque url and should never\ntry to assemble it. While the uuid parameter may be an actual UUID, this\nproposal imposes no constraints on the format and clients should never impose\nany.\nIf clients need to correlate local upload state with remote upload state, the\ncontents of the Docker-Upload-UUID header should be used. Such an id can be\nused to key the last used location header when implementing resumable uploads.\nUpload Progress\nThe progress and chunk coordination of the upload process will be coordinated\nthrough the Range header. While this is a non-standard use of the Range\nheader, there are examples of similar approaches in APIs with heavy use.\nFor an upload that just started, for an example with a 1000 byte layer file,\nthe Range header would be as follows:\nRange: bytes=0-0\nTo get the status of an upload, issue a GET request to the upload URL:\nGET /v2//blobs/uploads/\nHost: \nThe response will be similar to the above, except will return 204 status:\n204 No Content\nLocation: /v2//blobs/uploads/\nRange: bytes=0-\nDocker-Upload-UUID: \nNote that the HTTP Range header byte ranges are inclusive and that will be\nhonored, even in non-standard use cases.\nMonolithic Upload\nA monolithic upload is simply a chunked upload with a single chunk and may be\nfavored by clients that would like to avoided the complexity of chunking. To\ncarry out a \"monolithic\" upload, one can simply put the entire content blob to\nthe provided URL:\nPUT /v2//blobs/uploads/?digest=\nContent-Length: \nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n\nThe \"digest\" parameter must be included with the PUT request. Please see the\nCompleted Upload section for details on the parameters\nand expected responses.\nChunked Upload\nTo carry out an upload of a chunk, the client can specify a range header and\nonly include that part of the layer file:\nPATCH /v2//blobs/uploads/\nContent-Length: \nContent-Range: -\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n\nThere is no enforcement on layer chunk splits other than that the server must\nreceive them in order. The server may enforce a minimum chunk size. If the\nserver cannot accept the chunk, a 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable\nresponse will be returned and will include a Range header indicating the\ncurrent status:\n416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable\nLocation: /v2//blobs/uploads/\nRange: 0-\nContent-Length: 0\nDocker-Upload-UUID: \nIf this response is received, the client should resume from the \"last valid\nrange\" and upload the subsequent chunk. A 416 will be returned under the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nInvalid Content-Range header format\nOut of order chunk: the range of the next chunk must start immediately after\nthe \"last valid range\" from the previous response.\n\nWhen a chunk is accepted as part of the upload, a 202 Accepted response will\nbe returned, including a Range header with the current upload status:\n202 Accepted\nLocation: /v2//blobs/uploads/\nRange: bytes=0-\nContent-Length: 0\nDocker-Upload-UUID: \nCompleted Upload\nFor an upload to be considered complete, the client must submit a PUT\nrequest on the upload endpoint with a digest parameter. If it is not provided,\nthe upload will not be considered complete. The format for the final chunk\nwill be as follows:\nPUT /v2//blobs/uploads/?digest=\nContent-Length: \nContent-Range: -\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n\nOptionally, if all chunks have already been uploaded, a PUT request with a\ndigest parameter and zero-length body may be sent to complete and validate\nthe upload. Multiple \"digest\" parameters may be provided with different\ndigests. The server may verify none or all of them but must notify the\nclient if the content is rejected.\nWhen the last chunk is received and the layer has been validated, the client\nwill receive a 201 Created response:\n201 Created\nLocation: /v2//blobs/\nContent-Length: 0\nDocker-Content-Digest: \nThe Location header will contain the registry URL to access the accepted\nlayer file. The Docker-Content-Digest header returns the canonical digest of\nthe uploaded blob which may differ from the provided digest. Most clients may\nignore the value but if it is used, the client should verify the value against\nthe uploaded blob data.\nDigest Parameter\nThe \"digest\" parameter is designed as an opaque parameter to support\nverification of a successful transfer. For example, an HTTP URI parameter\nmight be as follows:\nsha256:6c3c624b58dbbcd3c0dd82b4c53f04194d1247c6eebdaab7c610cf7d66709b3b\nGiven this parameter, the registry will verify that the provided content does\nmatch this digest.\nCanceling an Upload\nAn upload can be cancelled by issuing a DELETE request to the upload endpoint.\nThe format will be as follows:\nDELETE /v2//blobs/uploads/\nAfter this request is issued, the upload uuid will no longer be valid and the\nregistry server will dump all intermediate data. While uploads will time out\nif not completed, clients should issue this request if they encounter a fatal\nerror but still have the ability to issue an http request.\nCross Repository Blob Mount\nA blob may be mounted from another repository that the client has read access\nto, removing the need to upload a blob already known to the registry. To issue\na blob mount instead of an upload, a POST request should be issued in the\nfollowing format:\nPOST /v2//blobs/uploads/?mount=&from=\nContent-Length: 0\nIf the blob is successfully mounted, the client will receive a 201 Created\nresponse:\n201 Created\nLocation: /v2//blobs/\nContent-Length: 0\nDocker-Content-Digest: \nThe Location header will contain the registry URL to access the accepted\nlayer file. The Docker-Content-Digest header returns the canonical digest of\nthe uploaded blob which may differ from the provided digest. Most clients may\nignore the value but if it is used, the client should verify the value against\nthe uploaded blob data.\nIf a mount fails due to invalid repository or digest arguments, the registry\nwill fall back to the standard upload behavior and return a 202 Accepted with\nthe upload URL in the Location header:\n202 Accepted\nLocation: /v2//blobs/uploads/\nRange: bytes=0-\nContent-Length: 0\nDocker-Upload-UUID: \nThis behavior is consistent with older versions of the registry, which do not\nrecognize the repository mount query parameters.\nNote: a client may issue a HEAD request to check existence of a blob in a source\nrepository to distinguish between the registry not supporting blob mounts and\nthe blob not existing in the expected repository.\nErrors\nIf an 502, 503 or 504 error is received, the client should assume that the\ndownload can proceed due to a temporary condition, honoring the appropriate\nretry mechanism. Other 5xx errors should be treated as terminal.\nIf there is a problem with the upload, a 4xx error will be returned indicating\nthe problem. After receiving a 4xx response (except 416, as called out above),\nthe upload will be considered failed and the client should take appropriate\naction.\nNote that the upload url will not be available forever. If the upload uuid is\nunknown to the registry, a 404 Not Found response will be returned and the\nclient must restart the upload process.\nDeleting a Layer\nA layer may be deleted from the registry via its name and digest. A\ndelete may be issued with the following request format:\nDELETE /v2//blobs/\nIf the blob exists and has been successfully deleted, the following response\nwill be issued:\n202 Accepted\nContent-Length: None\nIf the blob had already been deleted or did not exist, a 404 Not Found\nresponse will be issued instead.\nIf a layer is deleted which is referenced by a manifest in the registry,\nthen the complete images will not be resolvable.\nPushing an Image Manifest\nOnce all of the layers for an image are uploaded, the client can upload the\nimage manifest. An image can be pushed using the following request format:\nPUT /v2//manifests/\nContent-Type: \n\n{\n   \"name\": ,\n   \"tag\": ,\n   \"fsLayers\": [\n      {\n         \"blobSum\": \n      },\n      ...\n    ]\n   ],\n   \"history\": ,\n   \"signature\": ,\n   ...\n}\nThe name and reference fields of the response body must match those\nspecified in the URL. The reference field may be a \"tag\" or a \"digest\". The\ncontent type should match the type of the manifest being uploaded, as specified\nin manifest-v2-1.md and manifest-v2-2.md.\nIf there is a problem with pushing the manifest, a relevant 4xx response will\nbe returned with a JSON error message. Please see the\nPUT Manifest section for details on possible error codes that\nmay be returned.\nIf one or more layers are unknown to the registry, BLOB_UNKNOWN errors are\nreturned. The detail field of the error response will have a digest field\nidentifying the missing blob. An error is returned for each unknown blob. The\nresponse format is as follows:\n{\n    \"errors\": [{\n            \"code\": \"BLOB_UNKNOWN\",\n            \"message\": \"blob unknown to registry\",\n            \"detail\": {\n                \"digest\": \n            }\n        },\n        ...\n    ]\n}\nListing Repositories\nImages are stored in collections, known as a repository, which is keyed by a\nname, as seen throughout the API specification. A registry instance may\ncontain several repositories. The list of available repositories is made\navailable through the catalog.\nThe catalog for a given registry can be retrieved with the following request:\nGET /v2/_catalog\nThe response will be in the following format:\n200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"repositories\": [\n    ,\n    ...\n  ]\n}\nNote that the contents of the response are specific to the registry\nimplementation. Some registries may opt to provide a full catalog output,\nlimit it based on the user's access level or omit upstream results, if\nproviding mirroring functionality. Subsequently, the presence of a repository\nin the catalog listing only means that the registry may provide access to\nthe repository at the time of the request. Conversely, a missing entry does\nnot mean that the registry does not have the repository. More succinctly,\nthe presence of a repository only guarantees that it is there but not that it\nis not there.\nFor registries with a large number of repositories, this response may be quite\nlarge. If such a response is expected, one should use pagination. A registry\nmay also limit the amount of responses returned even if pagination was not\nexplicitly requested. In this case the Link header will be returned along\nwith the results, and subsequent results can be obtained by following the link\nas if pagination had been initially requested.\nFor details of the Link header, please see the Pagination\nsection.\nPagination\nPaginated catalog results can be retrieved by adding an n parameter to the\nrequest URL, declaring that the response should be limited to n results.\nStarting a paginated flow begins as follows:\nGET /v2/_catalog?n=\nThe above specifies that a catalog response should be returned, from the start of\nthe result set, ordered lexically, limiting the number of results to n. The\nresponse to such a request would look as follows:\n200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nLink: ?n=&last=>; rel=\"next\"\n\n{\n  \"repositories\": [\n    ,\n    ...\n  ]\n}\nThe above includes the first n entries from the result set. To get the\nnext n entries, one can create a URL where the argument last has the\nvalue from repositories[len(repositories)-1]. If there are indeed more\nresults, the URL for the next block is encoded in an\nRFC5988 Link header, as a \"next\"\nrelation. The presence of the Link header communicates to the client that\nthe entire result set has not been returned and another request must be\nissued. If the header is not present, the client can assume that all results\nhave been received.\n\nNOTE: In the request template above, note that the brackets\nare required. For example, if the url is\nhttp://example.com/v2/_catalog?n=20&last=b, the value of the header would\nbe ; rel=\"next\". Please see\nRFC5988 for details.\n\nCompliant client implementations should always use the Link header\nvalue when proceeding through results linearly. The client may construct URLs\nto skip forward in the catalog.\nTo get the next result set, a client would issue the request as follows, using\nthe URL encoded in the described Link header:\nGET /v2/_catalog?n=&last=\nThe above process should then be repeated until the Link header is no longer\nset.\nThe catalog result set is represented abstractly as a lexically sorted list,\nwhere the position in that list can be specified by the query term last. The\nentries in the response start after the term specified by last, up to n\nentries.\nThe behavior of last is quite simple when demonstrated with an example. Let\nus say the registry has the following repositories:\na\nb\nc\nd\nIf the value of n is 2, a and b will be returned on the first response.\nThe Link header returned on the response will have n set to 2 and last set\nto b:\nLink: ?n=2&last=b>; rel=\"next\"\nThe client can then issue the request with the above value from the Link\nheader, receiving the values c and d. Note that n may change on the second\nto last response or be fully omitted, depending on the server implementation.\nListing Image Tags\nIt may be necessary to list all of the tags under a given repository. The tags\nfor an image repository can be retrieved with the following request:\nGET /v2//tags/list\nThe response will be in the following format:\n200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n    \"name\": ,\n    \"tags\": [\n        ,\n        ...\n    ]\n}\nFor repositories with a large number of tags, this response may be quite\nlarge. If such a response is expected, one should use the pagination.\nPagination\nPaginated tag results can be retrieved by adding the appropriate parameters to\nthe request URL described above. The behavior of tag pagination is identical\nto that specified for catalog pagination. We cover a simple flow to highlight\nany differences.\nStarting a paginated flow may begin as follows:\nGET /v2//tags/list?n=\nThe above specifies that a tags response should be returned, from the start of\nthe result set, ordered lexically, limiting the number of results to n. The\nresponse to such a request would look as follows:\n200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nLink: ?n=&last=>; rel=\"next\"\n\n{\n  \"name\": ,\n  \"tags\": [\n    ,\n    ...\n  ]\n}\nTo get the next result set, a client would issue the request as follows, using\nthe value encoded in the RFC5988 Link\nheader:\nGET /v2//tags/list?n=&last=\nThe above process should then be repeated until the Link header is no longer\nset in the response. The behavior of the last parameter, the provided\nresponse result, lexical ordering and encoding of the Link header are\nidentical to that of catalog pagination.\nDeleting an Image\nAn image may be deleted from the registry via its name and reference. A\ndelete may be issued with the following request format:\nDELETE /v2//manifests/\nFor deletes, reference must be a digest or the delete will fail. If the\nimage exists and has been successfully deleted, the following response will be\nissued:\n202 Accepted\nContent-Length: None\nIf the image had already been deleted or did not exist, a 404 Not Found\nresponse will be issued instead.\n\nNote  When deleting a manifest from a registry version 2.3 or later, the\nfollowing header must be used when HEAD or GET-ing the manifest to obtain\nthe correct digest to delete:\n\nAccept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\n\nfor more details, see: compatibility.md\n\nDetail\n\nNote: This section is still under construction. For the purposes of\nimplementation, if any details below differ from the described request flows\nabove, the section below should be corrected. When they match, this note\nshould be removed.\n\nThe behavior of the endpoints are covered in detail in this section, organized\nby route and entity. All aspects of the request and responses are covered,\nincluding headers, parameters and body formats. Examples of requests and their\ncorresponding responses, with success and failure, are enumerated.\n\nNote: The sections on endpoint detail are arranged with an example\nrequest, a description of the request, followed by information about that\nrequest.\n\nA list of methods and URIs are covered in the table below:\n\n\n\nMethod\nPath\nEntity\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGET\n/v2/\nBase\nCheck that the endpoint implements Docker Registry API V2.\n\n\nGET\n/v2//tags/list\nTags\nFetch the tags under the repository identified by name.\n\n\nGET\n/v2//manifests/\nManifest\nFetch the manifest identified by name and reference where reference can be a tag or digest.

schema version has two primary goals. The first is to allow\nmulti-architecture images, through a \"fat manifest\" which references image\nmanifests for platform-specific versions of an image. The second is to\nmove the Docker engine towards content-addressable images, by supporting\nan image model where the image's configuration can be hashed to generate\nan ID for the image.\nMedia Types\nThe following media types are used by the manifest formats described here, and\nthe resources they reference:\n\napplication/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v1+json: schema1 (existing manifest format)\napplication/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json: New image manifest format (schemaVersion = 2)\napplication/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json: Manifest list, aka \"fat manifest\"\napplication/vnd.docker.container.image.v1+json: Container config JSON\napplication/vnd.docker.image.rootfs.diff.tar.gzip: \"Layer\", as a gzipped tar\napplication/vnd.docker.image.rootfs.foreign.diff.tar.gzip: \"Layer\", as a gzipped tar that should never be pushed\napplication/vnd.docker.plugin.v1+json: Plugin config JSON\n\nManifest List\nThe manifest list is the \"fat manifest\" which points to specific image manifests\nfor one or more platforms.

If uploading this manifest fails,\npresumably because the registry only supports the old format, the client may\nfall back to uploading a manifest in the old format.\nWhen pulling images, clients indicate support for this new version of the\nmanifest format by sending the\napplication/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json and\napplication/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json media types in an\nAccept header when making a request to the manifests endpoint. Updated\nclients should check the Content-Type header to see whether the manifest\nreturned from the endpoint is in the old format, or is an image manifest or\nmanifest list in the new format.\nIf the manifest being requested uses the new format, and the appropriate media\ntype is not present in an Accept header, the registry will assume that the\nclient cannot handle the manifest as-is, and rewrite it on the fly into the old\nformat. If the object that would otherwise be returned is a manifest list, the\nregistry will look up the appropriate manifest for the amd64 platform and\nlinux OS, rewrite that manifest into the old format if necessary, and return\nthe result to the client. If no suitable manifest is found in the manifest\nlist, the registry will return a 404 error.\nOne of the challenges in rewriting manifests to the old format is that the old\nformat involves an image configuration for each layer in the manifest, but the\nnew format only provides one image configuration. To work around this, the\nregistry will create synthetic image configurations for all layers except the\ntop layer. These image configurations will not result in runnable images on\ntheir own, but only serve to fill in the parent chain in a compatible way.\nThe IDs in these synthetic configurations will be derived from hashes of their\nrespective blobs. The registry will create these configurations and their IDs\nusing the same scheme as Docker 1.10 when it creates a legacy manifest to push\nto a registry which doesn't support the new format.\n"},"spec/menu.html":{"url":"spec/menu.html","title":"Reference","summary":"Explains registry JSON objects","keywords":"","body":""},"storage-drivers/azure.html":{"url":"storage-drivers/azure.html","title":"Microsoft Azure Storage Driver","summary":"Explains how to use the Azure storage drivers","keywords":"","body":"An implementation of the storagedriver.StorageDriver interface which uses Microsoft Azure Blob Storage for object storage.\nParameters\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\naccountname\nyes\nName of the Azure Storage Account.\n\n\naccountkey\nyes\nPrimary or Secondary Key for the Storage Account.\n\n\ncontainer\nyes\nName of the Azure root storage container in which all registry data is stored.

Registry\n2.3 supports all three manifest types and sometimes performs an on-the-fly\ntransformation of a manifest before serving the JSON in the response, to\npreserve compatibility with older versions of Docker Engine.\nThis conversion has some implications for pulling manifests by digest and this\ndocument enumerates these implications.\nContent Addressable Storage (CAS)\nManifests are stored and retrieved in the registry by keying off a digest\nrepresenting a hash of the contents. One of the advantages provided by CAS is\nsecurity: if the contents are changed, then the digest no longer matches.\nThis prevents any modification of the manifest by a MITM attack or an untrusted\nthird party.\nWhen a manifest is stored by the registry, this digest is returned in the HTTP\nresponse headers and, if events are configured, delivered within the event. The\nmanifest can either be retrieved by the tag, or this digest.\nFor registry versions 2.2.1 and below, the registry always stores and\nserves Schema 1 manifests. Engine 1.10 first\nattempts to send a Schema 2 manifest, falling back to sending a\nSchema 1 type manifest when it detects that the registry does not\nsupport the new version.\nRegistry v2.3\nManifest push with Docker 1.10\nThe Engine constructs a Schema 2 manifest which the\nregistry persists to disk.\nWhen the manifest is pulled by digest or tag with Docker Engine 1.10, a\nSchema 2 manifest is returned. Docker Engine 1.10\nunderstands the new manifest format.\nWhen the manifest is pulled by tag with Docker Engine 1.9 and older, the\nmanifest is converted on-the-fly to Schema 1 and sent in the\nresponse. The Docker Engine 1.9 is compatible with this older format.\nWhen the manifest is pulled by digest with Docker Engine 1.9 and older, the\nsame rewriting process does not happen in the registry. If it did,\nthe digest would no longer match the hash of the manifest and would violate the\nconstraints of CAS.\nFor this reason if a manifest is pulled by digest from a registry 2.3 with Docker\nEngine 1.9 and older, and the manifest was pushed with Docker Engine 1.10, a\nsecurity check causes the Engine to receive a manifest it cannot use and the\npull fails.\nManifest push with Docker 1.9 and older\nThe Docker Engine constructs a Schema 1 manifest which the\nregistry persists to disk.\nWhen the manifest is pulled by digest or tag with any Docker version, a\nSchema 1 manifest is returned.\n"},"configuration.html":{"url":"configuration.html","title":"Configuring A Registry","summary":"Explains how to configure a registry","keywords":"","body":"The Registry configuration is based on a YAML file, detailed below.

Read the detailed reference information about each\noption before finalizing your configuration.\nversion: 0.1\nlog:\n  accesslog:\n    disabled: true\n  level: debug\n  formatter: text\n  fields:\n    service: registry\n    environment: staging\n  hooks:\n    -

In these cases, you can omit the parent with\nall its children. However, if the parent is included, you must also include all\nthe children marked required.\nversion\nversion: 0.1\n\nThe version option is required. It specifies the configuration's version.\nIt is expected to remain a top-level field, to allow for a consistent version\ncheck before parsing the remainder of the configuration file.\nlog\nThe log subsection configures the behavior of the logging system. The logging\nsystem outputs everything to stderr.

You must configure exactly one backend. If you configure more, the registry\nreturns an error. You can choose any of these backend storage drivers:\n\n\n\nStorage driver\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfilesystem\nUses the local disk to store registry files. It is ideal for development and may be appropriate for some small-scale production applications. See the driver's reference documentation.\n\n\nazure\nUses Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. See the driver's reference documentation.\n\n\ngcs\nUses Google Cloud Storage. See the driver's reference documentation.\n\n\ns3\nUses Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and compatible Storage Services. See the driver's reference documentation.\n\n\nswift\nUses Openstack Swift object storage. See the driver's reference documentation.\n\n\noss\nUses Aliyun OSS for object storage. See the driver's reference documentation.\n\n\n\nFor testing only, you can use the inmemory storage\ndriver.\nIf you would like to run a registry from volatile memory, use the\nfilesystem driver\non a ramdisk.\nIf you are deploying a registry on Windows, a Windows volume mounted from the\nhost is not recommended. Instead, you can use a S3 or Azure backing\ndata-store. If you do use a Windows volume, the length of the PATH to\nthe mount point must be within the MAX_PATH limits (typically 255 characters),\nor this error will occur:\nmkdir /XXX protocol error and your registry will not function properly.\n\nmaintenance\nCurrently, upload purging and read-only mode are the only maintenance\nfunctions available.\nuploadpurging\nUpload purging is a background process that periodically removes orphaned files\nfrom the upload directories of the registry. Upload purging is enabled by\ndefault. To configure upload directory purging, the following parameters must\nbe set.\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nenabled\nyes\nSet to true to enable upload purging. Defaults to true.\n\n\nage\nyes\nUpload directories which are older than this age will be deleted.Defaults to 168h (1 week).\n\n\ninterval\nyes\nThe interval between upload directory purging. Defaults to 24h.\n\n\ndryrun\nyes\nSet dryrun to true to obtain a summary of what directories will be deleted. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n\nNote: age and interval are strings containing a number with optional\nfraction and a unit suffix. Some examples: 45m, 2h10m, 168h.\n\nreadonly\nIf the readonly section under maintenance has enabled set to true,\nclients will not be allowed to write to the registry. This mode is useful to\ntemporarily prevent writes to the backend storage so a garbage collection pass\ncan be run.  Before running garbage collection, the registry should be\nrestarted with readonly's enabled set to true. After the garbage collection\npass finishes, the registry may be restarted again, this time with readonly\nremoved from the configuration (or set to false).\ndelete\nUse the delete structure to enable the deletion of image blobs and manifests\nby digest. It defaults to false, but it can be enabled by writing the following\non the configuration file:\ndelete:\n  enabled: true\n\ncache\nUse the cache structure to enable caching of data accessed in the storage\nbackend. Currently, the only available cache provides fast access to layer\nmetadata, which uses the blobdescriptor field if configured.\nYou can set blobdescriptor field to redis or inmemory. If set to redis,a\nRedis pool caches layer metadata. If set to inmemory, an in-memory map caches\nlayer metadata.\n\nNOTE: Formerly, blobdescriptor was known as layerinfo. While these\nare equivalent, layerinfo has been deprecated.\n\nIf blobdescriptor is set to inmemory, the optional blobdescriptorsize\nparameter sets a limit on the number of descriptors to store in the cache.\nThe default value is 10000. If this parameter is set to 0, the cache is allowed\nto grow with no size limit.\nredirect\nThe redirect subsection provides configuration for managing redirects from\ncontent backends. For backends that support it, redirecting is enabled by\ndefault. In certain deployment scenarios, you may decide to route all data\nthrough the Registry, rather than redirecting to the backend. This may be more\nefficient when using a backend that is not co-located or when a registry\ninstance is aggressively caching.\nTo disable redirects, add a single flag disable, set to true\nunder the redirect section:\nredirect:\n  disable: true\n\nauth\nauth:\n  silly:\n    realm: silly-realm\n    service: silly-service\n  token:\n    realm: token-realm\n    service: token-service\n    issuer: registry-token-issuer\n    rootcertbundle: /root/certs/bundle\n  htpasswd:\n    realm: basic-realm\n    path: /path/to/htpasswd\n\nThe auth option is optional. Possible auth providers include:\n\nsilly\ntoken\nhtpasswd\n[none]\n\nYou can configure only one authentication provider.\nsilly\nThe silly authentication provider is only appropriate for development. It simply checks\nfor the existence of the Authorization header in the HTTP request. It does not\ncheck the header's value. If the header does not exist, the silly auth\nresponds with a challenge response, echoing back the realm, service, and scope\nfor which access was denied.\nThe following values are used to configure the response:\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrealm\nyes\nThe realm in which the registry server authenticates.\n\n\nservice\nyes\nThe service being authenticated.\n\n\n\ntoken\nToken-based authentication allows you to decouple the authentication system from\nthe registry. It is an established authentication paradigm with a high degree of\nsecurity.\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrealm\nyes\nThe realm in which the registry server authenticates.\n\n\nservice\nyes\nThe service being authenticated.\n\n\nissuer\nyes\nThe name of the token issuer. The issuer inserts this into the token so it must match the value configured for the issuer.\n\n\nrootcertbundle\nyes\nThe absolute path to the root certificate bundle. This bundle contains the public part of the certificates used to sign authentication tokens.\n\n\nautoredirect\nno\nWhen set to true, realm will automatically be set using the Host header of the request as the domain and a path of /auth/token/\n\n\n\nFor more information about Token based authentication configuration, see the\nspecification.\nhtpasswd\nThe htpasswd authentication backed allows you to configure basic\nauthentication using an\nApache htpasswd file.\nThe only supported password format is\nbcrypt. Entries with other hash types\nare ignored. The htpasswd file is loaded once, at startup. If the file is\ninvalid, the registry will display an error and will not start.\n\nWarning: If the htpasswd file is missing, the file will be created and provisioned with a default user and automatically generated password.\nThe password will be printed to stdout.\nWarning: Only use the htpasswd authentication scheme with TLS\nconfigured, since basic authentication sends passwords as part of the HTTP\nheader.\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrealm\nyes\nThe realm in which the registry server authenticates.\n\n\npath\nyes\nThe path to the htpasswd file to load at startup.\n\n\n\nmiddleware\nThe middleware structure is optional. Use this option to inject middleware at\nnamed hook points. Each middleware must implement the same interface as the\nobject it is wrapping. For instance, a registry middleware must implement the\ndistribution.Namespace interface, while a repository middleware must implement\ndistribution.Repository, and a storage middleware must implement\ndriver.StorageDriver.\nThis is an example configuration of the cloudfront  middleware, a storage\nmiddleware:\nmiddleware:\n  registry:\n    - name: ARegistryMiddleware\n      options:\n        foo: bar\n  repository:\n    - name: ARepositoryMiddleware\n      options:\n        foo: bar\n  storage:\n    - name: cloudfront\n      options:\n        baseurl: https://my.cloudfronted.domain.com/\n        privatekey: /path/to/pem\n        keypairid: cloudfrontkeypairid\n        duration: 3000s\n        ipfilteredby: awsregion\n        awsregion: us-east-1, use-east-2\n        updatefrequency: 12h\n        iprangesurl: https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json\n\nEach middleware entry has name and options entries. The name must\ncorrespond to the name under which the middleware registers itself. The\noptions field is a map that details custom configuration required to\ninitialize the middleware. It is treated as a map[string]interface{}. As such,\nit supports any interesting structures desired, leaving it up to the middleware\ninitialization function to best determine how to handle the specific\ninterpretation of the options.\ncloudfront\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nbaseurl\nyes\nThe SCHEME://HOST[/PATH] at which Cloudfront is served.\n\n\nprivatekey\nyes\nThe private key for Cloudfront, provided by AWS.\n\n\nkeypairid\nyes\nThe key pair ID provided by AWS.\n\n\nduration\nno\nAn integer and unit for the duration of the Cloudfront session. Valid time units are ns, us (or µs), ms, s, m, or h. For example, 3000s is valid, but 3000 s is not. If you do not specify a duration or you specify an integer without a time unit, the duration defaults to 20m (20 minutes).\n\n\nipfilteredby\nno\nA string with the following value none, aws or awsregion.\n\n\nawsregion\nno\nA comma separated string of AWS regions, only available when ipfilteredby is awsregion. For example, us-east-1, us-west-2\n\n\nupdatefrequency\nno\nThe frequency to update AWS IP regions, default: 12h\n\n\niprangesurl\nno\nThe URL contains the AWS IP ranges information, default: https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json\n\n\n\nValue of ipfilteredby can be:\n\n\n\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnone\ndefault, do not filter by IP\n\n\naws\nIP from AWS goes to S3 directly\n\n\nawsregion\nIP from certain AWS regions goes to S3 directly, use together with awsregion.\n\n\n\nalicdn\nalicdn storage middleware allows the registry to serve layers via a content delivery network provided by Alibaba Cloud. Alicdn requires the OSS storage driver.\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nbaseurl\nyes\nThe SCHEME://HOST at which Alicdn is served.\n\n\nauthtype\nyes\nThe URL authentication type for Alicdn, which should be a, b or c. See the Authentication configuration.\n\n\nprivatekey\nyes\nThe URL authentication key for Alicdn.\n\n\nduration\nno\nAn integer and unit for the duration of the Alicdn session. Valid time units are ns, us (or µs), ms, s, m, or h.\n\n\n\nredirect\nYou can use the redirect storage middleware to specify a custom URL to a\nlocation of a proxy for the layer stored by the S3 storage driver.\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nbaseurl\nyes\nSCHEME://HOST at which layers are served.

They are enabled by default. This option deprecates the enabled flag.\nmanifests\nUse the manifests subsection to configure validation of manifests. If\ndisabled is false, the validation allows nothing.\nurls\nThe allow and deny options are each a list of\nregular expressions that restrict the URLs in\npushed manifests.\nIf allow is unset, pushing a manifest containing URLs fails.\nIf allow is set, pushing a manifest succeeds only if all URLs match\none of the allow regular expressions and one of the following holds:\n\ndeny is unset.\ndeny is set but no URLs within the manifest match any of the deny regular\nexpressions.\n\nExample: Development configuration\nYou can use this simple example for local development:\nversion: 0.1\nlog:\n  level: debug\nstorage:\n    filesystem:\n        rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry\nhttp:\n    addr: localhost:5000\n    secret: asecretforlocaldevelopment\n    debug:\n        addr: localhost:5001\n\nThis example configures the registry instance to run on port 5000, binding to\nlocalhost, with the debug server enabled. Registry data is stored in the\n/var/lib/registry directory. Logging is set to debug mode, which is the most\nverbose.\nSee\nconfig-example.yml\nfor another simple configuration. Both examples are generally useful for local\ndevelopment.\nExample: Middleware configuration\nThis example configures Amazon Cloudfront\nas the storage middleware in a registry. Middleware allows the registry to serve\nlayers via a content delivery network (CDN). This reduces requests to the\nstorage layer.\nCloudfront requires the S3 storage driver.\nThis is the configuration expressed in YAML:\nmiddleware:\n  storage:\n  - name: cloudfront\n    disabled: false\n    options:\n      baseurl: http://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net\n      privatekey: /path/to/asecret.pem\n      keypairid: asecret\n      duration: 60s\n\nSee the configuration reference for Cloudfront for more\ninformation about configuration options.\n\nNote: Cloudfront keys exist separately from other AWS keys.  See\nthe documentation on AWS credentials\nfor more information.\n\n"},"deploying.html":{"url":"deploying.html","title":"Deploy A Registry Server","summary":"Explains how to deploy a registry","keywords":"","body":"Before you can deploy a registry, you need to install Docker on the host.\nA registry is an instance of the registry image, and runs within Docker.\nThis topic provides basic information about deploying and configuring a\nregistry. For an exhaustive list of configuration options, see the\nconfiguration reference.\nIf you have an air-gapped datacenter, see\nConsiderations for air-gapped registries.\nRun a local registry\nUse a command like the following to start the registry container:\n$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2\n\nThe registry is now ready to use.\n\nWarning: These first few examples show registry configurations that are\nonly appropriate for testing. A production-ready registry must be protected by\nTLS and should ideally use an access-control mechanism. Keep reading and then\ncontinue to the configuration guide to deploy a\nproduction-ready registry.\n\nCopy an image from Docker Hub to your registry\nYou can pull an image from Docker Hub and push it to your registry. The\nfollowing example pulls the ubuntu:16.04 image from Docker Hub and re-tags it\nas my-ubuntu, then pushes it to the local registry. Finally, the\nubuntu:16.04 and my-ubuntu images are deleted locally and the\nmy-ubuntu image is pulled from the local registry.\n\nPull the ubuntu:16.04 image from Docker Hub.\n$ docker pull ubuntu:16.04\n\n\nTag the image as localhost:5000/my-ubuntu. This creates an additional tag\nfor the existing image. When the first part of the tag is a hostname and\nport, Docker interprets this as the location of a registry, when pushing.\n$ docker tag ubuntu:16.04 localhost:5000/my-ubuntu\n\n\nPush the image to the local registry running at localhost:5000:\n$ docker push localhost:5000/my-ubuntu\n\n\nRemove the locally-cached ubuntu:16.04 and localhost:5000/my-ubuntu\nimages, so that you can test pulling the image from your registry. This\ndoes not remove the localhost:5000/my-ubuntu image from your registry.\n$ docker image remove ubuntu:16.04\n$ docker image remove localhost:5000/my-ubuntu\n\n\nPull the localhost:5000/my-ubuntu image from your local registry.\n$ docker pull localhost:5000/my-ubuntu\n\n\n\nStop a local registry\nTo stop the registry, use the same docker container stop command as with any other\ncontainer.\n$ docker container stop registry\n\nTo remove the container, use docker container rm.\n$ docker container stop registry && docker container rm -v registry\n\nBasic configuration\nTo configure the container, you can pass additional or modified options to the\ndocker run command.\nThe following sections provide basic guidelines for configuring your registry.\nFor more details, see the registry configuration reference.\nStart the registry automatically\nIf you want to use the registry as part of your permanent infrastructure, you\nshould set it to restart automatically when Docker restarts or if it exits.\nThis example uses the --restart always flag to set a restart policy for the\nregistry.\n$ docker run -d \\\n  -p 5000:5000 \\\n  --restart=always \\\n  --name registry \\\n  registry:2\n\nCustomize the published port\nIf you are already using port 5000, or you want to run multiple local\nregistries to separate areas of concern, you can customize the registry's\nport settings. This example runs the registry on port 5001 and also names it\nregistry-test. Remember, the first part of the -p value is the host port\nand the second part is the port within the container. Within the container, the\nregistry listens on port 5000 by default.\n$ docker run -d \\\n  -p 5001:5000 \\\n  --name registry-test \\\n  registry:2\n\nIf you want to change the port the registry listens on within the container, you\ncan use the environment variable REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR to change it. This command\ncauses the registry to listen on port 5001 within the container:\n$ docker run -d \\\n  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:5001 \\\n  -p 5001:5001 \\\n  --name registry-test \\\n  registry:2\n\nStorage customization\nCustomize the storage location\nBy default, your registry data is persisted as a docker volume\non the host filesystem. If you want to store your registry contents at a specific\nlocation on your host filesystem, such as if you have an SSD or SAN mounted into\na particular directory, you might decide to use a bind mount instead. A bind mount\nis more dependent on the filesystem layout of the Docker host, but more performant\nin many situations. The following example bind-mounts the host directory\n/mnt/registry into the registry container at /var/lib/registry/.\n$ docker run -d \\\n  -p 5000:5000 \\\n  --restart=always \\\n  --name registry \\\n  -v /mnt/registry:/var/lib/registry \\\n  registry:2\n\nCustomize the storage back-end\nBy default, the registry stores its data on the local filesystem, whether you\nuse a bind mount or a volume. You can store the registry data in an Amazon S3\nbucket, Google Cloud Platform, or on another storage back-end by using\nstorage drivers. For more information, see\nstorage configuration options.\nRun an externally-accessible registry\nRunning a registry only accessible on localhost has limited usefulness. In\norder to make your registry accessible to external hosts, you must first secure\nit using TLS.\nThis example is extended in Run the registry as a\nservice below.\nGet a certificate\nThese examples assume the following:\n\nYour registry URL is https://myregistry.domain.com/.\nYour DNS, routing, and firewall settings allow access to the registry's host\non port 443.\nYou have already obtained a certificate from a certificate authority (CA).\n\nIf you have been issued an intermediate certificate instead, see\nuse an intermediate certificate.\n\nCreate a certs directory.\n$ mkdir -p certs\n\nCopy the .crt and .key files from the CA into the certs directory.\nThe following steps assume that the files are named domain.crt and\ndomain.key.\n\nStop the registry if it is currently running.\n$ docker container stop registry\n\n\nRestart the registry, directing it to use the TLS certificate. This command\nbind-mounts the certs/ directory into the container at /certs/, and sets\nenvironment variables that tell the container where to find the domain.crt\nand domain.key file. The registry runs on port 443, the default HTTPS port.\n$ docker run -d \\\n  --restart=always \\\n  --name registry \\\n  -v \"$(pwd)\"/certs:/certs \\\n  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:443 \\\n  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt \\\n  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key \\\n  -p 443:443 \\\n  registry:2\n\n\nDocker clients can now pull from and push to your registry using its\nexternal address. The following commands demonstrate this:\n$ docker pull ubuntu:16.04\n$ docker tag ubuntu:16.04 myregistry.domain.com/my-ubuntu\n$ docker push myregistry.domain.com/my-ubuntu\n$ docker pull myregistry.domain.com/my-ubuntu\n\n\n\nUse an intermediate certificate\nA certificate issuer may supply you with an intermediate certificate. In this\ncase, you must concatenate your certificate with the intermediate certificate to\nform a certificate bundle. You can do this using the cat command:\ncat domain.crt intermediate-certificates.pem > certs/domain.crt\n\nYou can use the certificate bundle just as you use the domain.crt file in\nthe previous example.\nSupport for Let's Encrypt\nThe registry supports using Let's Encrypt to automatically obtain a\nbrowser-trusted certificate. For more information on Let's Encrypt, see\nhttps://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/\nand the relevant section of the\nregistry configuration.\nUse an insecure registry (testing only)\nIt is possible to use a self-signed certificate, or to use our registry\ninsecurely. Unless you have set up verification for your self-signed\ncertificate, this is for testing only. See run an insecure registry.\nRun the registry as a service\nSwarm services provide several advantages over\nstandalone containers. They use a declarative model, which means that you define\nthe desired state and Docker works to keep your service in that state. Services\nprovide automatic load balancing scaling, and the ability to control the\ndistribution of your service, among other advantages. Services also allow you to\nstore sensitive data such as TLS certificates in\nsecrets.\nThe storage back-end you use determines whether you use a fully scaled service\nor a service with either only a single node or a node constraint.\n\nIf you use a distributed storage driver, such as Amazon S3, you can use a\nfully replicated service. Each worker can write to the storage back-end\nwithout causing write conflicts.\n\nIf you use a local bind mount or volume, each worker node writes to its\nown storage location, which means that each registry contains a different\ndata set. You can solve this problem by using a single-replica service and a\nnode constraint to ensure that only a single worker is writing to the bind\nmount.\n\n\nThe following example starts a registry as a single-replica service, which is\naccessible on any swarm node on port 80. It assumes you are using the same\nTLS certificates as in the previous examples.\nFirst, save the TLS certificate and key as secrets:\n$ docker secret create domain.crt certs/domain.crt\n\n$ docker secret create domain.key certs/domain.key\n\nNext, add a label to the node where you want to run the registry.\nTo get the node's name, use docker node ls. Substitute your node's name for\nnode1 below.\n$ docker node update --label-add registry=true node1\n\nNext, create the service, granting it access to the two secrets and constraining\nit to only run on nodes with the label registry=true. Besides the constraint,\nyou are also specifying that only a single replica should run at a time. The\nexample bind-mounts /mnt/registry on the swarm node to /var/lib/registry/\nwithin the container. Bind mounts rely on the pre-existing source directory,\nso be sure /mnt/registry exists on node1. You might need to create it before\nrunning the following docker service create command.\nBy default, secrets are mounted into a service at /run/secrets/.\n$ docker service create \\\n  --name registry \\\n  --secret domain.crt \\\n  --secret domain.key \\\n  --constraint 'node.labels.registry==true' \\\n  --mount type=bind,src=/mnt/registry,dst=/var/lib/registry \\\n  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:443 \\\n  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/run/secrets/domain.crt \\\n  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/run/secrets/domain.key \\\n  --publish published=443,target=443 \\\n  --replicas 1 \\\n  registry:2\n\nYou can access the service on port 443 of any swarm node. Docker sends the\nrequests to the node which is running the service.\nLoad balancing considerations\nOne may want to use a load balancer to distribute load, terminate TLS or\nprovide high availability. While a full load balancing setup is outside the\nscope of this document, there are a few considerations that can make the process\nsmoother.\nThe most important aspect is that a load balanced cluster of registries must\nshare the same resources. For the current version of the registry, this means\nthe following must be the same:\n\nStorage Driver\nHTTP Secret\nRedis Cache (if configured)\n\nDifferences in any of the above cause problems serving requests.\nAs an example, if you're using the filesystem driver, all registry instances\nmust have access to the same filesystem root, on\nthe same machine. For other drivers, such as S3 or Azure, they should be\naccessing the same resource and share an identical configuration.\nThe HTTP Secret coordinates uploads, so also must be the same across\ninstances. Configuring different redis instances works (at the time\nof writing), but is not optimal if the instances are not shared, because\nmore requests are directed to the backend.\nImportant/Required HTTP-Headers\nGetting the headers correct is very important. For all responses to any\nrequest under the \"/v2/\" url space, the Docker-Distribution-API-Version\nheader should be set to the value \"registry/2.0\", even for a 4xx response.\nThis header allows the docker engine to quickly resolve authentication realms\nand fallback to version 1 registries, if necessary. Confirming this is setup\ncorrectly can help avoid problems with fallback.\nIn the same train of thought, you must make sure you are properly sending the\nX-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-For, and Host headers to their \"client-side\"\nvalues. Failure to do so usually makes the registry issue redirects to internal\nhostnames or downgrading from https to http.\nA properly secured registry should return 401 when the \"/v2/\" endpoint is hit\nwithout credentials. The response should include a WWW-Authenticate\nchallenge, providing guidance on how to authenticate, such as with basic auth\nor a token service. If the load balancer has health checks, it is recommended\nto configure it to consider a 401 response as healthy and any other as down.\nThis secures your registry by ensuring that configuration problems with\nauthentication don't accidentally expose an unprotected registry. If you're\nusing a less sophisticated load balancer, such as Amazon's Elastic Load\nBalancer, that doesn't allow one to change the healthy response code, health\nchecks can be directed at \"/\", which always returns a 200 OK response.\nRestricting access\nExcept for registries running on secure local networks, registries should always\nimplement access restrictions.\nNative basic auth\nThe simplest way to achieve access restriction is through basic authentication\n(this is very similar to other web servers' basic authentication mechanism).\nThis example uses native basic authentication using htpasswd to store the\nsecrets.\n\nWarning:\nYou cannot use authentication with authentication schemes that send\ncredentials as clear text. You must\nconfigure TLS first for\nauthentication to work.\n{:.warning}\nWarning\nThe official registry image only supports htpasswd credentials in\nbcrypt format, so if you omit the -B option when generating the credential\nusing htpasswd, all authentication attempts will fail.\n{:.warning}\n\n\nCreate a password file with one entry for the user testuser, with password\ntestpassword:\n$ mkdir auth\n$ docker run \\\n  --entrypoint htpasswd \\\n  httpd:2 -Bbn testuser testpassword > auth/htpasswd\n\nOn Windows, make sure the output file is correctly encoded:\ndocker run --rm --entrypoint htpasswd httpd:2 -Bbn testuser testpassword | Set-Content -Encoding ASCII auth/htpasswd\n\n\nStop the registry.\n$ docker container stop registry\n\n\nStart the registry with basic authentication.\n$ docker run -d \\\n  -p 5000:5000 \\\n  --restart=always \\\n  --name registry \\\n  -v \"$(pwd)\"/auth:/auth \\\n  -e \"REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd\" \\\n  -e \"REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=Registry Realm\" \\\n  -e REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/auth/htpasswd \\\n  -v \"$(pwd)\"/certs:/certs \\\n  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt \\\n  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key \\\n  registry:2\n\n\nTry to pull an image from the registry, or push an image to the registry.\nThese commands fail.\n\nLog in to the registry.\n$ docker login myregistrydomain.com:5000\n\nProvide the username and password from the first step.\nTest that you can now pull an image from the registry or push an image to\nthe registry.\n\n\n\nX509 errors: X509 errors usually indicate that you are attempting to use\na self-signed certificate without configuring the Docker daemon correctly.\nSee run an insecure registry.\n\nMore advanced authentication\nYou may want to leverage more advanced basic auth implementations by using a\nproxy in front of the registry. See the recipes list.\nThe registry also supports delegated authentication which redirects users to a\nspecific trusted token server. This approach is more complicated to set up, and\nonly makes sense if you need to fully configure ACLs and need more control over\nthe registry's integration into your global authorization and authentication\nsystems. Refer to the following background information and\nconfiguration information here.\nThis approach requires you to implement your own authentication system or\nleverage a third-party implementation.\nDeploy your registry using a Compose file\nIf your registry invocation is advanced, it may be easier to use a Docker\ncompose file to deploy it, rather than relying on a specific docker run\ninvocation. Use the following example docker-compose.yml as a template.\nregistry:\n  restart: always\n  image: registry:2\n  ports:\n    - 5000:5000\n  environment:\n    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE: /certs/domain.crt\n    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY: /certs/domain.key\n    REGISTRY_AUTH: htpasswd\n    REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH: /auth/htpasswd\n    REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM: Registry Realm\n  volumes:\n    - /path/data:/var/lib/registry\n    - /path/certs:/certs\n    - /path/auth:/auth\n\nReplace /path with the directory which contains the certs/ and auth/\ndirectories.\n{:.warning}\nStart your registry by issuing the following command in the directory containing\nthe docker-compose.yml file:\n$ docker-compose up -d\n\nConsiderations for air-gapped registries\nYou can run a registry in an environment with no internet connectivity.\nHowever, if you rely on any images which are not local, you need to consider the\nfollowing:\n\nYou may need to build your local registry's data volume on a connected\nhost where you can run docker pull to get any images which are available\nremotely, and then migrate the registry's data volume to the air-gapped\nnetwork.\n\nCertain images, such as the official Microsoft Windows base images, are not\ndistributable. This means that when you push an image based on one of these\nimages to your private registry, the non-distributable layers are not\npushed, but are always fetched from their authorized location. This is fine\nfor internet-connected hosts, but not in an air-gapped set-up.\nYou can configure the Docker daemon to allow pushing non-distributable layers \nto private registries.\nThis is only useful in air-gapped set-ups in the presence of\nnon-distributable images, or in extremely bandwidth-limited situations.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that you are in compliance with the terms of\nuse for non-distributable layers.\n\nEdit the daemon.json file, which is located in /etc/docker/ on Linux\nhosts and C:\\ProgramData\\docker\\config\\daemon.json on Windows Server.\nAssuming the file was previously empty, add the following contents:\n{\n  \"allow-nondistributable-artifacts\": [\"myregistrydomain.com:5000\"]\n}\n\nThe value is an array of registry addresses, separated by commas.\nSave and exit the file.\n\nRestart Docker.\n\nRestart the registry if it does not start automatically.\n\nWhen you push images to the registries in the list, their\nnon-distributable layers are pushed to the registry.\n\nWarning: Non-distributable artifacts typically have restrictions on\nhow and where they can be distributed and shared. Only use this feature\nto push artifacts to private registries and ensure that you are in\ncompliance with any terms that cover redistributing non-distributable\nartifacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\nMore specific and advanced information is available in the following sections:\n\nConfiguration reference\nWorking with notifications\nAdvanced \"recipes\"\nRegistry API\nStorage driver model\nToken authentication\n\n"},"deprecated.html":{"url":"deprecated.html","title":"Docker Registry Deprecation","summary":"describes deprecated functionality","keywords":"","body":"This document details functionality or components which are deprecated within\nthe registry.\nv2.5.0\nThe signature store has been removed from the registry.

Blobs can include both layers and manifests.\nRegistry data can occupy considerable amounts of disk space. In addition,\ngarbage collection can be a security consideration, when it is desirable to ensure\nthat certain layers no longer exist on the filesystem.\nGarbage collection in practice\nFilesystem layers are stored by their content address in the Registry. This\nhas many advantages, one of which is that data is stored once and referred to by manifests.\nSee here for more details.\nLayers are therefore shared amongst manifests; each manifest maintains a reference\nto the layer. As long as a layer is referenced by one manifest, it cannot be garbage\ncollected.\nManifests and layers can be deleted with the registry API (refer to the API\ndocumentation here and\nhere for details). This API removes references\nto the target and makes them eligible for garbage collection. It also makes them\nunable to be read via the API.\nIf a layer is deleted, it is removed from the filesystem when garbage collection\nis run. If a manifest is deleted the layers to which it refers are removed from\nthe filesystem if no other manifests refers to them.\nExample\nIn this example manifest A references two layers: a and b. Manifest B references\nlayers a and c. In this state, nothing is eligible for garbage collection:\nA -----> a  b     |\n         c Manifest B is deleted via the API:\nA -----> a     B\n    \\--> b\n         c\nIn this state layer c no longer has a reference and is eligible for garbage\ncollection. Layer a had one reference removed but not garbage\ncollected as it is still referenced by manifest A. The blob representing\nmanifest B is eligible for garbage collection.\nAfter garbage collection has been run, manifest A and its blobs remain.\nA -----> a\n    \\--> b\nMore details about garbage collection\nGarbage collection runs in two phases. First, in the 'mark' phase, the process\nscans all the manifests in the registry. From these manifests, it constructs a\nset of content address digests. This set is the 'mark set' and denotes the set\nof blobs to not delete. Secondly, in the 'sweep' phase, the process scans all\nthe blobs and if a blob's content address digest is not in the mark set, the\nprocess deletes it.\n\nNote: You should ensure that the registry is in read-only mode or not running at\nall. If you were to upload an image while garbage collection is running, there is the\nrisk that the image's layers are mistakenly deleted leading to a corrupted image.\n\nThis type of garbage collection is known as stop-the-world garbage collection.\nRun garbage collection\nGarbage collection can be run as follows\nbin/registry garbage-collect [--dry-run] /path/to/config.yml\nThe garbage-collect command accepts a --dry-run parameter, which prints the progress\nof the mark and sweep phases without removing any data. Running with a log level of info\ngives a clear indication of items eligible for deletion.\nThe config.yml file should be in the following format:\nversion: 0.1\nstorage:\n  filesystem:\n    rootdirectory: /registry/data\n\nSample output from a dry run garbage collection with registry log level set to info\nhello-world\nhello-world: marking manifest sha256:fea8895f450959fa676bcc1df0611ea93823a735a01205fd8622846041d0c7cf\nhello-world: marking blob sha256:03f4658f8b782e12230c1783426bd3bacce651ce582a4ffb6fbbfa2079428ecb\nhello-world: marking blob sha256:a3ed95caeb02ffe68cdd9fd84406680ae93d633cb16422d00e8a7c22955b46d4\nhello-world: marking configuration sha256:690ed74de00f99a7d00a98a5ad855ac4febd66412be132438f9b8dbd300a937d\nubuntu\n\n4 blobs marked, 5 blobs eligible for deletion\nblob eligible for deletion: sha256:28e09fddaacbfc8a13f82871d9d66141a6ed9ca526cb9ed295ef545ab4559b81\nblob eligible for deletion: sha256:7e15ce58ccb2181a8fced7709e9893206f0937cc9543bc0c8178ea1cf4d7e7b5\nblob eligible for deletion: sha256:87192bdbe00f8f2a62527f36bb4c7c7f4eaf9307e4b87e8334fb6abec1765bcb\nblob eligible for deletion: sha256:b549a9959a664038fc35c155a95742cf12297672ca0ae35735ec027d55bf4e97\nblob eligible for deletion: sha256:f251d679a7c61455f06d793e43c06786d7766c88b8c24edf242b2c08e3c3f599\n"},"glossary.html":{"url":"glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nThis page contains definitions for distribution related terms.\n\n    Blob\n    \n      A blob is any kind of content that is stored by a Registry under a content-addressable identifier (a \"digest\").\n      \n          Layers are a good example of \"blobs\".\n      \n    \n\n    Image\n    \n      An image is a named set of immutable data from which a Docker container can be created.\n      \n      An image is represented by a json file called a manifest, and is conceptually a set of layers.\n\n      Image names indicate the location where they can be pulled from and pushed to, as they usually start with a registry domain name and port.\n\n      \n    \n\n    Layer\n    \n    A layer is a tar archive bundling partial content from a filesystem.\n    \n    Layers from an image are usually extracted in order on top of each other to make up a root filesystem from which containers run out.\n    \n    \n\n    Manifest\n    A manifest is the JSON representation of an image.\n\n    Namespace\n    A namespace is a collection of repositories with a common name prefix.\n    \n    The namespace with an empty prefix is considered the Global Namespace.\n    \n    \n\n    Registry\n    A registry is a service that let you store and deliver images.\n    \n\n    Repository\n    \n    A repository is a set of data containing all versions of a given image.\n    \n\n    Scope\n    A scope is the portion of a namespace onto which a given authorization token is granted.\n\n    Tag\n    A tag is conceptually a \"version\" of a named image.\n    \n    Example: `docker pull myimage:latest` instructs docker to pull the image \"myimage\" in version \"latest\".\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n"},"help.html":{"url":"help.html","title":"Get Help","summary":"Getting help with the Registry","keywords":"","body":"If you need help, or just want to chat about development, you can reach us on the #distribution channel in the CNCF Slack.\nIf you want to report a bug:\n\nbe sure to first read about how to contribute.\nyou can then do so on the GitHub project bugtracker.\n\nYou can also find out more about the Docker's project Getting Help resources.\n"},"insecure.html":{"url":"insecure.html","title":"Test An Insecure Registry","summary":"Deploying a Registry in an insecure fashion","keywords":"","body":"While it's highly recommended to secure your registry using a TLS certificate\nissued by a known CA, you can choose to use self-signed certificates, or use\nyour registry over an unencrypted HTTP connection.

A notification from the\nRegistry would then trigger a deployment on a staging environment, or notify\nother systems that a new image is available.\nIt's also an essential component if you want to quickly deploy a new image over\na large cluster of machines.\nFinally, it's the best way to distribute images inside an isolated network.\nRequirements\nYou absolutely need to be familiar with Docker, specifically with regard to\npushing and pulling images. You must understand the difference between the\ndaemon and the cli, and at least grasp basic concepts about networking.\nAlso, while just starting a registry is fairly easy, operating it in a\nproduction environment requires operational skills, just like any other service.\nYou are expected to be familiar with systems availability and scalability,\nlogging and log processing, systems monitoring, and security 101. Strong\nunderstanding of http and overall network communications, plus familiarity with\ngolang are certainly useful as well for advanced operations or hacking.\nNext\nDive into deploying your registry\n"},"migration.html":{"url":"migration.html","title":"Migration","keywords":"","body":"Migrating a 1.0 registry to 2.0\nTODO: This needs to be revised in light of Olivier's work\nA few thoughts here:\nThere was no \"1.0\".

One must convert v1 images to v2 images using a docker client or other tool.\nOne can migrate images from one version to the other by pulling images from the old registry and pushing them to the v2 registry.\n\nThe Docker Registry 2.0 is backward compatible with images created by the earlier specification. If you are migrating a private registry to version 2.0, you should use the following process:\n\nConfigure and test a 2.0 registry image in a sandbox environment.\n\nBack up up your production image storage.\n Your production image storage should reside on a volume or storage backend.\n Make sure you have a backup of its contents.\n\nStop your existing registry service.\n\nRestart your registry with your tested 2.0 image.\n\n\n"},"notifications.html":{"url":"notifications.html","title":"Work With Notifications","summary":"Explains how to work with registry notifications","keywords":"","body":"The Registry supports sending webhook notifications in response to events\nhappening within the registry. Notifications are sent in response to manifest\npushes and pulls and layer pushes and pulls. These actions are serialized into\nevents. The events are queued into a registry-internal broadcast system which\nqueues and dispatches events to Endpoints.\n\nEndpoints\nNotifications are sent to endpoints via HTTP requests. Each configured\nendpoint has isolated queues, retry configuration and http targets within each\ninstance of a registry. When an action happens within the registry, it is\nconverted into an event which is dropped into an inmemory queue. When the\nevent reaches the end of the queue, an http request is made to the endpoint\nuntil the request succeeds. The events are sent serially to each endpoint but\norder is not guaranteed.\nConfiguration\nTo setup a registry instance to send notifications to endpoints, one must add\nthem to the configuration. A simple example follows:\nnotifications:\n  endpoints:\n    - name: alistener\n      url: https://mylistener.example.com/event\n      headers:\n        Authorization: [Bearer ]\n      timeout: 500ms\n      threshold: 5\n      backoff: 1s\n\nThe above would configure the registry with an endpoint to send events to\nhttps://mylistener.example.com/event, with the header \"Authorization: Bearer\n\". The request would timeout after 500 milliseconds. If\n5 failures happen consecutively, the registry backs off for 1 second before\ntrying again.\nFor details on the fields, see the configuration documentation.\nA properly configured endpoint should lead to a log message from the registry\nupon startup:\nINFO[0000] configuring endpoint alistener (https://mylistener.example.com/event), timeout=500ms, headers=map[Authorization:[Bearer ]]  app.id=812bfeb2-62d6-43cf-b0c6-152f541618a3 environment=development service=registry\nEvents\nEvents have a well-defined JSON structure and are sent as the body of\nnotification requests. One or more events are sent in a structure called an\nenvelope. Each event has a unique ID that can be used to uniquely identify incoming\nrequests, if required. Along with that, an action is provided with a\ntarget, identifying the object mutated during the event.\nThe fields available in an event are described below.\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\nstring\nID provides a unique identifier for the event.\n\n\ntimestamp\nTime\nTimestamp is the time at which the event occurred.\n\n\naction\nstring\nAction indicates what action encompasses the provided event.\n\n\ntarget\ndistribution.Descriptor\nTarget uniquely describes the target of the event.\n\n\nlength\nint\nLength in bytes of content. Same as Size field in Descriptor.\n\n\nrepository\nstring\nRepository identifies the named repository.\n\n\nfromRepository\nstring\nFromRepository identifies the named repository which a blob was mounted from if appropriate.\n\n\nurl\nstring\nURL provides a direct link to the content.\n\n\ntag\nstring\nTag identifies a tag name in tag events.\n\n\nrequest\nRequestRecord\nRequest covers the request that generated the event.\n\n\nactor\nActorRecord.\nActor specifies the agent that initiated the event. For most situations, this could be from the authorization context of the request.\n\n\nsource\nSourceRecord\nSource identifies the registry node that generated the event. Put differently, while the actor \"initiates\" the event, the source \"generates\" it.\n\n\n\nThe following is an example of a JSON event, sent in response to the pull of a\nmanifest:\n{\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"320678d8-ca14-430f-8bb6-4ca139cd83f7\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2016-03-09T14:44:26.402973972-08:00\",\n      \"action\": \"pull\",\n      \"target\": {\n        \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json\",\n        \"digest\": \"sha256:fea8895f450959fa676bcc1df0611ea93823a735a01205fd8622846041d0c7cf\",\n        \"size\": 708,\n        \"length\": 708,\n        \"repository\": \"hello-world\",\n        \"url\": \"http://192.168.100.227:5000/v2/hello-world/manifests/sha256:fea8895f450959fa676bcc1df0611ea93823a735a01205fd8622846041d0c7cf\",\n        \"tag\": \"latest\"\n      },\n      \"request\": {\n        \"id\": \"6df24a34-0959-4923-81ca-14f09767db19\",\n        \"addr\": \"192.168.64.11:42961\",\n        \"host\": \"192.168.100.227:5000\",\n        \"method\": \"GET\",\n        \"useragent\": \"curl/7.38.0\"\n      },\n      \"actor\": {},\n      \"source\": {\n        \"addr\": \"xtal.local:5000\",\n        \"instanceID\": \"a53db899-3b4b-4a62-a067-8dd013beaca4\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThe target struct of events which are sent when manifests and blobs are deleted\ncontains a subset of the data contained in Get and Put events. Specifically,\nonly the digest and repository are sent.\n{\n  \"target\": {\n    \"digest\": \"sha256:d89e1bee20d9cb344674e213b581f14fbd8e70274ecf9d10c514bab78a307845\",\n    \"repository\": \"library/test\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nNote: As of version 2.1, the length field for event targets\nis being deprecated for the size field, bringing the target in line with\ncommon nomenclature. Both will continue to be set for the foreseeable\nfuture. Newer code should favor size but accept either.\n\nEnvelope\nThe envelope contains one or more events, with the following json structure:\n{\n  \"events\": [ \"...\" ]\n}\n\nWhile events may be sent in the same envelope, the set of events within that\nenvelope have no implied relationship. For example, the registry may choose to\ngroup unrelated events and send them in the same envelope to reduce the total\nnumber of requests.\nThe full package has the mediatype\n\"application/vnd.docker.distribution.events.v1+json\", which is set on the\nrequest coming to an endpoint.\nAn example of a full event may look as follows:\n```http request\nPOST /callback HTTP/1.1\nHost: application/vnd.docker.distribution.events.v1+json\nAuthorization: Bearer \nContent-Type: application/vnd.docker.distribution.events.v1+json\n{\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"asdf-asdf-asdf-asdf-0\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z\",\n      \"action\": \"push\",\n      \"target\": {\n        \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v1+json\",\n        \"digest\": \"sha256:fea8895f450959fa676bcc1df0611ea93823a735a01205fd8622846041d0c7cf\",\n        \"length\": 1,\n        \"repository\": \"library/test\",\n        \"url\": \"https://example.com/v2/library/test/manifests/sha256:c3b3692957d439ac1928219a83fac91e7bf96c153725526874673ae1f2023f8d5\"\n      },\n      \"request\": {\n        \"id\": \"asdfasdf\",\n        \"addr\": \"client.local\",\n        \"host\": \"registrycluster.local\",\n        \"method\": \"PUT\",\n        \"useragent\": \"test/0.1\"\n      },\n      \"actor\": {\n        \"name\": \"test-actor\"\n      },\n      \"source\": {\n        \"addr\": \"hostname.local:port\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"asdf-asdf-asdf-asdf-1\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z\",\n      \"action\": \"push\",\n      \"target\": {\n        \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.container.image.rootfs.diff+x-gtar\",\n        \"digest\": \"sha256:c3b3692957d439ac1928219a83fac91e7bf96c153725526874673ae1f2023f8d5\",\n        \"length\": 2,\n        \"repository\": \"library/test\",\n        \"url\": \"https://example.com/v2/library/test/blobs/sha256:c3b3692957d439ac1928219a83fac91e7bf96c153725526874673ae1f2023f8d5\"\n      },\n      \"request\": {\n        \"id\": \"asdfasdf\",\n        \"addr\": \"client.local\",\n        \"host\": \"registrycluster.local\",\n        \"method\": \"PUT\",\n        \"useragent\": \"test/0.1\"\n      },\n      \"actor\": {\n        \"name\": \"test-actor\"\n      },\n      \"source\": {\n        \"addr\": \"hostname.local:port\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"asdf-asdf-asdf-asdf-2\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z\",\n      \"action\": \"push\",\n      \"target\": {\n        \"mediaType\": \"application/vnd.docker.container.image.rootfs.diff+x-gtar\",\n        \"digest\": \"sha256:c3b3692957d439ac1928219a83fac91e7bf96c153725526874673ae1f2023f8d5\",\n        \"length\": 3,\n        \"repository\": \"library/test\",\n        \"url\": \"https://example.com/v2/library/test/blobs/sha256:c3b3692957d439ac1928219a83fac91e7bf96c153725526874673ae1f2023f8d5\"\n      },\n      \"request\": {\n        \"id\": \"asdfasdf\",\n        \"addr\": \"client.local\",\n        \"host\": \"registrycluster.local\",\n        \"method\": \"PUT\",\n        \"useragent\": \"test/0.1\"\n      },\n      \"actor\": {\n        \"name\": \"test-actor\"\n      },\n      \"source\": {\n        \"addr\": \"hostname.local:port\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n## Responses\n\nThe registry is fairly accepting of the response codes from endpoints. If an\nendpoint responds with any 2xx or 3xx response code (after following\nredirects), the message is considered to have been delivered, and is discarded.\n\nIn turn, it is recommended that endpoints are accepting of incoming responses,\nas well. While the format of event envelopes are standardized by media type,\nany \"pickyness\" about validation may cause the queue to backup on the\nregistry.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe state of the endpoints are reported via the debug/vars http interface,\nusually configured to `http://localhost:5001/debug/vars`. Information such as\nconfiguration and metrics are available by endpoint.\n\nThe following provides an example of a few endpoints that have experienced\nseveral failures and have since recovered:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"notifications\": {\n    \"endpoints\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"local-5003\",\n        \"url\": \"http://localhost:5003/callback\",\n        \"Headers\": {\n          \"Authorization\": [\n            \"Bearer \\u003can example token\\u003e\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"Timeout\": 1000000000,\n        \"Threshold\": 10,\n        \"Backoff\": 1000000000,\n        \"Metrics\": {\n          \"Pending\": 76,\n          \"Events\": 76,\n          \"Successes\": 0,\n          \"Failures\": 0,\n          \"Errors\": 46,\n          \"Statuses\": {\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"local-8083\",\n        \"url\": \"http://localhost:8083/callback\",\n        \"Headers\": null,\n        \"Timeout\": 1000000000,\n        \"Threshold\": 10,\n        \"Backoff\": 1000000000,\n        \"Metrics\": {\n          \"Pending\": 0,\n          \"Events\": 76,\n          \"Successes\": 76,\n          \"Failures\": 0,\n          \"Errors\": 28,\n          \"Statuses\": {\n            \"202 Accepted\": 76\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\nIf using notification as part of a larger application, it is critical to\nmonitor the size (\"Pending\" above) of the endpoint queues. If failures or\nqueue sizes are increasing, it can indicate a larger problem.\nThe logs are also a valuable resource for monitoring problems. A failing\nendpoint leads to messages similar to the following:\nERRO[0340] retryingsink: error writing events: httpSink{http://localhost:5003/callback}: error posting: Post http://localhost:5003/callback: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:5003: connection refused, retrying\nWARN[0340] httpSink{http://localhost:5003/callback} encountered too many errors, backing off\n\nThe above indicates that several errors caused a backoff and the registry\nwaits before retrying.\nConsiderations\nCurrently, the queues are inmemory, so endpoints should be reasonably\nreliable. They are designed to make a best-effort to send the messages but if\nan instance is lost, messages may be dropped. If an endpoint goes down, care\nshould be taken to ensure that the registry instance is not terminated before\nthe endpoint comes back up or messages are lost.\nThis can be mitigated by running endpoints in close proximity to the registry\ninstances. One could run an endpoint that pages to disk and then forwards a\nrequest to provide better durability.\nThe notification system is designed around a series of interchangeable sinks\nwhich can be wired up to achieve interesting behavior. If this system doesn't\nprovide acceptable guarantees, adding a transactional Sink to the registry\nis a possibility, although it may have an effect on request service time.\nSee the\ngodoc\nfor more information.\n"},"./":{"url":"./","title":"Docker Registry","summary":"High-level overview of the Registry","keywords":"","body":"What it is\nThe Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores\nand lets you distribute Docker images.
